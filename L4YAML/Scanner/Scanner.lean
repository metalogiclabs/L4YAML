# YAML Scanner (Tokenizer) — Dispatch Umbrella

Phase 9: Character stream → Token stream.

The scanner implements the 132 lexical-layer (L) productions from YAML 1.2.2,
converting a character stream into an array of positioned `YamlToken` values.
The grammar parser (S-layer) then operates on tokens, never on raw characters.

## Architecture

```
String ──→ scan ──→ Array (Positioned YamlToken) ──→ [Grammar Parser] ──→ YamlValue
```

The scanner is a **pure function** `String → Except ScanError (Array (Positioned YamlToken))`.
Internally it uses `ScannerState` to track:
- Current position (offset, line, col)
- Indentation stack (for virtual BLOCK-START/BLOCK-END generation)
- Flow nesting level (flow vs. block context)
- Simple key tracking

## Design Decisions

1. **Batch scanning** (not lazy/on-demand like libyaml). The entire input is
   scanned to a token array before parsing begins. Pure function, easy to verify.

2. **Indentation stack** generates virtual tokens: `blockSequenceStart`,
   `blockMappingStart`, `blockEnd` — analogous to Python's INDENT/DEDENT.

3. **Scalar content is fully resolved**: escapes expanded, line folding applied,
   chomp style applied. The grammar parser receives clean strings.

4. **Context-sensitive.** The same character sequence may tokenize differently
   depending on indentation level, flow/block context, and scalar style.

## Submodule Organization (Blueprint Initiative 1 Phase 2)

The scanner was monolithic (~2761 LoC in one file).  It is now split into
role-named submodules, with this file as the dispatch umbrella:

- [`Scanner.State`](State.lean) — `ScannerState`, `WellFormed`, accessors.
- [`Scanner.Whitespace`](Whitespace.lean) — `skipWhitespace`, `skipSpaces`,
  `consumeNewline`, `skipToContent`, comments (§6.1–§6.7).
- [`Scanner.Indent`](Indent.lean) — virtual `BLOCK-*` generation via
  `unwindIndents`, `pushSequenceIndent`, `pushMappingIndent`.
- [`Scanner.Document`](Document.lean) — `---` / `...` markers, `%YAML` /
  `%TAG` directives (§6.8, §9.1.2).
- [`Scanner.NodeProperties`](NodeProperties.lean) — anchors, aliases,
  tags (§6.9).
- [`Scanner.Scalar`](Scalar.lean) — escape sequences, quoted/plain/block
  scalars, line folding (§5.7, §6.5, §7.3, §8.1).
- [`Scanner.SimpleKey`](SimpleKey.lean) — simple-key resolution,
  `scanBlockEntry` / `scanKey` / `scanValue`, candidate predicates
  (§7.4, §8.2).

This file owns the flow-collection indicator scanners (`[`, `]`, `{`,
`}`, `,`) and the `scanNextToken` dispatch / `scanLoop` / `scan` /
`scanFiltered` main loop.

## Production Rule Contracts

Each scanning function documents which YAML 1.2.2 production(s) it implements
and the contract governing its variables and state transitions.

### Variable Classification

Every numeric variable in the scanner has exactly one of these roles:

- **Position** (absolute column, 0-based): the column where something is or
  must be. Indentation levels are positions. Examples: `parentIndent`,
  `contentIndent`, `s.col`, `currentIndent`.

- **Distance** (character count): how many characters of a particular kind.
  Always non-negative. Examples: `explicitIndent` (the `m` in `s-indent(m)`),
  `spacesConsumed`.

- **Pos** (`YamlPos`): a full (offset, line, col) triple for token attribution.
  Examples: `startPos`, `simpleKey.pos`.

The fundamental relationship: `Position = Position + Distance`.
Never add two Positions or use a Distance where a Position is expected.

### Pre/Post-Condition Style

Each scanning function specifies:

- **Implements**: YAML 1.2.2 production number(s) and section.
- **Pre**: Required scanner state at entry (position, context, expectations).
- **Post**: Scanner state at exit (position advanced past matched content,
  token(s) emitted, flags set).
- **Error**: Conditions under which `Except.error` is returned.

/-! ### §7.5 [161]: a node property is delimited (item 9f)

    `[161] ns-flow-node(n,c)` reads `c-ns-properties` followed by EITHER
    `s-separate(n,c)` and `ns-flow-content` OR nothing at all (`e-scalar`); [104]
    `c-ns-alias-node` is likewise a whole node.  There is no third arm, so the
    character directly after a property (or alias) token is separation, an entry
    or collection boundary, or end of input — never the first character of
    content.

    Unlike the three tests above this one does NOT need the `s.inFlow` gate:
    it looks only FORWARD, at the character the same token's own walk stopped on,
    so no virtual block opening can sit between the two (Reflection 615).

    The character classes differ sharply between the two property forms, which is
    why so little reaches this test on the anchor side: `[102] ns-anchor-char` is
    `ns-char - c-flow-indicator`, so `&a"x"`, `&a*x`, `&a&b` and `&a:b` are each
    ONE anchor with a funny name, and only `,[]{}` end the token.  `[153]
    ns-tag-char` also subtracts everything outside `ns-uri-char`, so a tag stops
    at `"` — which is how `[!t"x"]` scanned clean before this. -/

/-- The characters that may directly follow a node property or an alias:
    separation (§6.1 `s-white`, §5.4 `b-break`), an entry or collection boundary
    (the node ended with `e-scalar`), or end of input. -/
def propertyFollowerOk (s : ScannerState) : Bool :=
  match s.peek? with
  | none => true

/-- `propertyFollowerOk` read off the state a property scan produced.  A failed
    scan reports its own error, so the test is vacuous there — which is what
    keeps item 9e's error precedence unchanged when the two guards share an
    `if`. -/
def propertyScanFollowerOk (r : Except ScanError ScannerState) : Bool :=
  match r with
  | .ok s' => propertyFollowerOk s'
  | .error _ => true

    reports is exactly the one the emitted token stops before. -/

  (collectAnchorNameLoop s.advance "" (s.inputEnd - s.advance.offset)).snd

/-! ### §7.4 [150]: a flow `?` opens an entry (item 9g)

    `[150] ns-flow-pair(n,c)` is `"?" s-separate ns-flow-map-explicit-entry`, and
    a `ns-flow-pair` is an *entry* of `[138] ns-s-flow-seq-entries` /
    `[141] ns-s-flow-map-entries`.  So a `?` may only stand where the collection
    is about to read a fresh entry: directly after its own `[`/`{`, or directly
    after a `,`.

    Every other predecessor has no derivation, and the scanner used to accept
    all of them:

    | input | tokens | why there is no derivation |
    |---|---|---|
    | `[? ? a]` | `key key …` | the explicit entry's key is an `ns-flow-yaml-node`, and `? ` starts no node |
    | `[: ?]` | `key value key` | the empty-key entry's value is an `ns-flow-node`, and `? ` starts none |
    | `[&a ? b]` | `anchor key …` | `[161]`'s properties are followed by `ns-flow-content`, and `? ` is not content |

    The three predecessors that *do* complete a value (`scalar`, `alias`, `]`,
    `}`) are already rejected one dispatcher earlier by
    `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency`, so what this adds is exactly the
    `key` / `value` / property cases — the tokens that are neither an entry
    boundary nor a completed value.

    Placed as a third conjunct on the `?` arm's existing dispatch condition
    rather than as a new `if`: a `?` that fails it falls through to
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent`, where `canStartPlainScalarBool` is false
    for every character `isKeyCandidate` admits (blank, or a flow indicator —
    neither is `ns-plain-safe`), so the fall-through is always
    `.unexpectedChar`.  The dispatcher gains no `if` and no join point
    (Reflection 613). -/

/-- Inside a flow collection, is the cursor at an entry boundary, where a `?`
    may open an `[150] ns-flow-pair`?  Vacuously true in block context, where
    `[191] c-l-block-map-explicit-key` is governed by indentation instead. -/

  !s.inFlow ||
    (match lastRealTokenVal? s.tokens with
     | some t => t.opensFlowEntry
     | none => false)

/-! ### §7.4.1 [150]: a flow `?` is DELIMITED (item 9j)

    Item 9g pinned the `?`'s *predecessor*; this pins its *successor*, and it is
    the same production read left to right:

        [150] ns-flow-pair(n,c) ::= ( "?" s-separate(n,c)
                                       ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) )
                                  | ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c)

    The `s-separate` after the `?` is **mandatory** — inside a flow collection it
    is `s-separate-lines(n)`, whose only zero-width arm is `/* Start of line */`,
    which a `?` sitting mid-line cannot take.  So the character directly after
    the indicator is blank or a break, never a flow indicator.

    `isKeyCandidate` admits a flow indicator (`isBlankBool n || (s.inFlow &&
    isFlowIndicatorBool n)`) — that second disjunct is what let

        [?]        [?,a]       {?}       {?,a}

    scan clean in BOTH pipelines.  None of the four has a derivation: `[142]
    c-ns-flow-map-explicit-entry` can be `( e-node e-node )`, so an EMPTY explicit
    entry is legal (`[? ]`, `[? , a]` are accepted and stay accepted), but the
    `s-separate` before it is not optional.  Nor can the `?` be a plain scalar:
    `[131] ns-plain-first` admits a leading `?` only when the next character is
    `ns-plain-safe(c)`, and in flow context `ns-plain-safe-in` subtracts exactly
    `c-flow-indicator`.

    Like 9g this rides on the `?` arm's dispatch condition rather than adding an
    `if` (Reflection 613), so a `?` that fails it falls through to
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent`; and by the same argument as 9g the
    fall-through is always `.unexpectedChar`, since the follower that got it here
    is a flow indicator and so not `ns-plain-safe`. -/

/-- §7.4.1 [150] (item 9j): inside a flow collection, is the `?` followed by the
    `s-separate` its production requires?  `none` (end of input) is left to the

    - `[7] c-collect-entry` = `","`

    **Pre**: Scanner at `,` inside a flow collection (`flowLevel > 0`).
    **Post**: Emits `flowEntry`, advances past `,`, sets `simpleKeyAllowed := true`
    and clears `explicitKeyLine`.
    **Error**: `invalidFlowEntry` if comma immediately follows a flow-open indicator
    (`[`, `{`) or another comma — catching leading/consecutive commas.

    **The `,` ENDS the explicit-key entry (item 9l).**  `scanKey` records
    `explicitKeyLine := some line` so that content on the `?`'s line is read as
    the explicit key's own node rather than as a fresh implicit key — the guard
    in `saveSimpleKey` and branch (1) of `scanValueClearKey`.  That scope is the
    ENTRY, not the line: `[150] ns-flow-pair`'s explicit alternative is one
    `ns-flow-seq-entry`, and `[138]`/`[141]`'s `","` starts the next one.
    Leaving the line set made every later entry on that line unable to reserve a
    simple key, so

        [? a, b: c]        [? a, : b]        [? a, : ]

    — all valid, all handled correctly by the flow-MAPPING parser — were
    REJECTED in a flow sequence (`expected ']' but reached end of tokens`): the
    retroactive `.key` token was never written, and `parseFlowSequenceLoop`
    dispatches on exactly that token.  The clear reaches exactly the entries of
    the `,`'s OWN collection (item 98): an enclosing `?`'s stamp is parked on
    `explicitKeyStack` by the flow open and restored by the matching close, so
    the block explicit key whose node contains a flow collection
    (`? [a, b]⏎: - w`) still resolves its landed `:` as `[197]`'s explicit
    value.

/-- §7.4 [137]/[140]: inside a flow collection every value must be

    indicator).  If the previous real token completed a value
    (`YamlToken.completesFlowValue`) and the next character starts a new
    node rather than a separator or the matching close (`]`/`}`), the
    entries are adjacent with no separator — invalid YAML (`[[a][b]]`,
    `[[a]b]`, `["a""b"]`).  Fires only on spec-invalid input (the emitter
    never produces separator-less flow entries), so it does not change
    `parseYaml` behaviour on any input the parser accepts.

    Called at the entry of `scanNextToken_dispatchFlowIndicators` — the
    first per-character dispatcher, which runs for *every* character
    before falling through to block/content dispatch — so the guard
    uniformly covers flow-indicator starts (`[`, `{`) and content starts
    (scalars, quotes, `*`, `&`, `!`) alike.

    **The `:` exemption is conditional (item 9d).**  `:` is exempt only
    when it will actually be consumed as a value indicator, i.e. when
    `isValueCandidate` holds — precisely the guard on the `:` arm of
    `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators`, which runs on the same state
    immediately after this dispatcher falls through.  A `:` that fails

/-! ### §7.1 [104]: an alias node ends its node (item 9h)

`[104] c-ns-alias-node ::= "*" ns-anchor-name` is a complete node — an
`ns-flow-node` [161] and, through `s-l+block-node` [196], a complete block node.
So in BLOCK context whatever follows it on the same line would have to be a
SECOND node in a slot that admits exactly one, and there is no derivation.

Every other block-context node terminator already says so, with one shared
allow-list — a line break, a `#` comment, or the `:` that makes the node an
implicit key:

* quoted scalars ([109]/[120]) — `validateTrailingContent`, called inside
  `scanDoubleQuoted` / `scanSingleQuoted`;
* a `]`/`}` that returns to block context ([137]/[140]) — `validateFlowClose`.

The alias arm had neither, and

    k: *a [b]   k: *a {b: c}   k: *a "x"   k: *a 'x'
    k: *a *a    k: *a plain    k: *a &b x  k: *a !t x   k: *a |

all scanned clean in BOTH pipelines (the parser rejects them later, with
`bareDocumentContent`, so this was never a shipped over-acceptance — but the
accumulation step could not refute them).  `validateAliasClose` closes it by
reusing the quoted-scalar sibling's own helper, so the allow-list is shared by
construction rather than restated.

**Why it is gated on `!inFlow`.**  Inside a flow collection the same job is
already done one dispatcher earlier: `.alias` is in `YamlToken.completesFlowValue`,
so `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency` (item 9b) rejects `[*a *b]` before content
dispatch is reached.

**Why the plain, block-scalar, anchor and tag arms need nothing.**  A plain
scalar in block context ABSORBS what follows (`ns-plain-safe-out` is `ns-char`,
so `k: foo [a]` is the one scalar `foo [a]`); a block scalar runs to the end of
its lines; and `&a`/`!t` are `c-ns-properties` [96], which are *supposed* to be
followed by content on the same line (`&a [b]` is one anchored node). -/

/-- §9.2 [211]: a bare document may only be the stream's first, or follow a
    `...`.  A node that is already complete, and content on a LATER line at a
    column NO OPEN LEVEL stands at, is a second bare document — `l-yaml-stream`
    offers no production for it.

    The three conjuncts are the whole reading, and each is a state field the
    scanner already maintains:

    * the landing column is not one of the open indent levels, so the content
      belongs to no collection the stream has started: it is neither the
      enclosing mapping's next key nor any indicator's content, and the
      collection it would roll in stands in a slot the completed node already
      fills.  A stack holding the sentinel alone is this condition's special
      case, since every landing column is `≥ 0` and the sentinel's is `-1`.  A
      dangling node AT an open level's own column is the complementary
      violation and belongs to its own check;
    * the last real token COMPLETES a node — `YamlToken.completesFlowValue`,
      the same set `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency` reads: a scalar of any
      style, an alias, or a flow close.  Node properties and the indicators
      are excluded because they precede or separate nodes rather than
      finishing one;
    * `simpleKeyAllowed` is up, which is exactly "a line break intervened".
      Every completing scan clears the flag and only a break re-arms it, so
      the same-line readings this must not touch (`[1, 2]: v` and `"x": 1`,
      where the completed node is an implicit KEY) are excluded by the flag
      rather than by a position comparison — the completing token's `endPos`
      is not populated for scalars, so a line test on the TOKEN would read a
      multi-line scalar's start.

    Runs after the structural dispatch, so `---`, `...` and directives are
    reached first and stay legal; a plain scalar absorbs its own continuation
    lines, so the completed-node state is reachable for that style only where
    the walk stops (a comment line, `hello⏎# c⏎world`).

    The parser refuses the same inputs one layer down
    (`StreamState.validNextToken`), at the same position and with this same
    error, so the check moves the refusal without moving any output.  That holds
    at an indented landing as much as at the sentinel: in `k:⏎␣␣"x"⏎␣␣b: 2` the
    scanner would roll a second `blockMappingStart` in at column 2, which the
    first document's reading has no slot for, and both refuse at `2,2`. -/

/-- §9.2 [211]: the DANGLING node run.  A trailing `[96]* (scalar|alias)?` whose
    start sits at an OPEN indent level's own column, and whose structural
    predecessor offers it no slot, belongs to nothing: the level it sits at is
    already occupied by the collection that opened it, and the run is neither
    that collection's next key nor any indicator's content.  §9.2 has no
    production for it, and the parser refuses it as `invalidBareDocument`.

    The three predecessors that DO offer a slot are `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`'s
    — `:`, `?` and `-` — and they are what keeps the equal-column value
    readings legal: `a:⏎b` is `{a: b}`, `?⏎b⏎: v` is the explicit key's content,
    `-⏎b` is the entry's.  What has no slot is a run behind a finished one
    (`a: 1⏎b`), behind a flow close (`k: [1, 2]⏎b`) or behind another dangler.

    The position reported is the RUN's start, not the cursor's, because that is
    where the offending node begins and where the parser reports.

    This reads the token array alone.  A property run's placeholders are never
    rewritten while the run is unresolved, so the run is visible there and no
    new state field is needed. -/

/-- §9.2 [211] mid-stream: the dangling run, once a line break has ended it.

    `simpleKeyAllowed` is that break, exactly as in
    `scanNextToken_checkBareDocument`: a run still on its own line may yet be
    resolved by a `:` (`a: 1⏎b: 2` — `b` becomes a key), and the flag is down
    there.  Runs BEFORE the structural dispatch, because a dangler dies at a
    `...`/`---` too (`a: 1⏎b⏎...`) and the marker would otherwise consume the
    step.

    **The two states are the landing's two halves, and they are not the same
    state** (item 140).  `s_land` is the landing — its flag is the break this
    check requires.  `s_run` is the state the landing ARRIVED with, and the run
    has to be read there: `scanNextToken_preprocess` unwinds the indent stack
    before it returns, and the unwind EMITS `blockEnd` and POPS the level, so a
    run whose own level the landing dedents past is no longer trailing and no
    longer sits at any open column.  Read at the landing alone, `k:⏎␣␣a: 1⏎␣␣b⏎c: 2`
    scans clean and only `TokenParser`'s `validNextToken` refuses it — at the
    same position, which is what says the two are the same refusal read at two
    depths.  `scanLoop_checkDanglingNode` below has always read the pre-unwind
    array (its own `unwindIndents s (-1)` comes after), so this makes the
    mid-stream check the end-of-input check's exact mid-stream twin.

    `skipToContent` writes neither tokens nor indents, so `s_run` may be the
    state `scanNextToken` was called with: the only writer between the two is
    the unwind, and the save's placeholders are what `prevRealIdx?` skips. -/

/-- §8.2.2 [194] / §7.5: a `:` that reaches CONTENT dispatch while a completed
    node's simple key is still recorded starts a second node in a one-node slot.

    The validators after a quoted scalar, alias, or flow close admit a `:` on
    the node's line because `[154]`/`[194]` make the node an implicit key — but
    that reading requires the `:` to BE the value indicator.  A `:` whose
    follower is not blank fails `isValueCandidate`, falls through the block
    dispatch, and would be read as a `[126]` plain-scalar head (`:b`) — a
    SECOND node after the completed one, which no production derives
    (`"a" :b`, `[1]:b`, `*x :b`).

    The recorded key separates the two `:`-as-plain families: at a genuine
    node-head position the key was saved fresh AT this character
    (`saveSimpleKey`, so `pos.offset = offset` — `k: :b`, `- :b`, `:b`), while
    after a completed node the save is the STALE one made at the node's own
    head (`pos.offset < offset`; the completed scan cleared
    `simpleKeyAllowed`, and only a line break re-arms it).  The
    `completesFlowValue` guard keeps property runs out: after `&a`/`!t` the
    stale save is the run's own head and `&x :b` is one anchored scalar.

    A flow close is refused on the TOKEN alone: `scanFlowSequenceEnd` restores
    the key saved at the matching open, and no invariant here couples that
    stack entry to the line — but after a `]`/`}` a `:` that is not the value
    indicator can never head a node (`[1]:b` glues, `[1]⏎:b` puts a bare

/-- Scan the next token from the input.

    **Implements**: Main dispatch loop for YAML token recognition.
    Called repeatedly by `scan` until input is exhausted.

    **Decomposed for provability**: Preprocessing and character dispatch are
    split into helper functions (`scanNextToken_preprocess`,
    `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural`, `scanNextToken_dispatchFlowIndicators`,
    `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators`, `scanNextToken_dispatchContent`)
    each with ≤ 7 branch points, keeping individual proofs tractable.

    Flow:
    1. `scanNextToken_preprocess` — skip whitespace, indent check, peek char
    2. `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural` — validation, document markers, directives
       (then the §9.1.5 and §9.2 stream-structure checks, which markers escape)
    3. `scanNextToken_dispatchFlowIndicators` — `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `,`
    4. `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators` — `-`, `?`, `:`
    5. `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` — `&`, `*`, `!`, `|`/`>`, `"`, `'`, plain

    **Pre**: Scanner state from previous token (or initial state).
    **Post**: Scanner past one token. Token emitted. State updated.
    **Error**: Unexpected character at current position; orphaned directives
    (§9.1.5); a second bare document (§9.2, `scanNextToken_checkBareDocument`);
    an under-indented flow open (§8.1); an unseparated `:` after a completed

/-- Structurally recursive helper for scan.

    Processes tokens one at a time using `scanNextToken`, with fuel decreasing
    on each iteration. Returns when either:
    - `scanNextToken` returns `none` (normal completion)
    - fuel is exhausted (error)

    **Design for provability**: Uses structural recursion on fuel parameter,
    enabling standard induction tactics for theorem proving. This replaces
    the imperative `for` loop in the original implementation.

    **Implements**: Core scanning loop with termination checking.
    **Post**: Same as `scan` - returns tokens starting with `streamStart`,
    ending with `streamEnd`.
    **Error**: Same error conditions as `scan`. -/

    **Implements**: Complete YAML tokenization pipeline.
    Wraps `scanNextToken` in a fuel-bounded loop (via `scanLoop`), bookended by
    `streamStart`/`streamEnd` tokens.

    **Refactored for provability**: Now uses structurally recursive `scanLoop`
    instead of imperative `for` loop, enabling formal verification via induction.

    All block collections are properly closed via `unwindIndents`.

    `directiveWithoutDocument` (orphan directives), `fuelExhausted`. -/
