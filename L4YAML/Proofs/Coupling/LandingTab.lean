/-! # The located tab and §6.1's own gate (DOCS item 64)

A white run that the grammar has split as `[63] s-indent(j)` followed by a TAB
names a character the scanner reads too, and this file is the bridge between
the two readings — item 62 built it inside `ScalarFoldAt` for the fold's blank
lines, and item 64 needs the same bridge one level up, inside preprocessing,
where `ScalarFoldAt` sits too high in the import graph to be used.

* **`skipSpaces_lands_at_tab`** — the surface split says the run opens with `j`
  spaces and then a tab, so the scanner's own space-skip ends exactly there, at
  column `sp.col + j`.  Its whole content is that the two splits COINCIDE:
  `skipSpaces` never stops on a space (`skipSpaces_peek_ne_space`), so the
  scanner's `j` and the grammar's are the same number.

* **`skipToContentWs_tab_under_indent`** — §6.1's gate, read as a fact about
  what survives it.  A tab at or left of the block's current indent leaves
  preprocessing only three ways: the line goes on to a comment, to a break, or
  to the end of input.  Anything else is `tabInIndentation`, so a landing whose
  run under-runs `s-indent(n)` and then carries a tab CANNOT be followed by
  content — which is what refutes the tab half of `WhiteRunUnderRun`.

The stream-level exemption (`currentIndent < 0`, where a tab before a flow
indicator is `[66] s-separate-in-line` rather than indentation) is excluded by
the caller's own floor: an under-run needs `0 < n`, and `n ≤ currentIndent + 1`
then forces `0 ≤ currentIndent`.

/-- **What a tab under the indent leaves of the line** (item 64).  A landing
    whose `[63] s-indent` run under-runs the pending's index and then carries a
    TAB cannot be followed by content: §6.1 refuses the tab unless the line
    stops there, so preprocessing ends at the input's end or at a `#`.

    Stated over the SCALARS the loop transports — the indent and the final
    peek — rather than over the scanner state, so that `unwindIndents` and
    `saveSimpleKey` carry it without a rewrite. -/

/-- The fact as the loop can state it.  §6.1's check runs on a line the loop
    ARRIVED at — so either the check was already armed on entry, or the loop
    crossed a break to get here, and `sp_mid ≠ sp` is how the surface says so.
    Writing the two as one premise is what lets the fact compose through the
    recursion: an iteration discharges it with the break it just consumed and
    never has to know which of the two its own caller had. -/
