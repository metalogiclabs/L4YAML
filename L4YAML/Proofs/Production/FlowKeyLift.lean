/-! # The closed flow node re-read as `[154]`'s key (DOCS item 56)

    A completed depth-0 flow collection followed by a same-line `:` is
    `[193] c-s-implicit-json-key`'s node — `c-flow-json-node(0, block-key)`.
    The collection was built at the frame's index in the `flow-out`/`flow-in`
    contexts; the KEY contexts read the same characters with two changes:
    the index drops to 0 and every interior separation must be
    `s-separate-in-line` (the key is single-line — which the scanner's
    §7.4 implicit-key checks enforce on everything that reaches a `:`).

    This file is the conversion family: one lemma per type of the flow
    grammar's mutual block, each `… → (converted) ∨ <residue>`, the residue
    taken on a multi-line interior (a `.commented` separation or a multi-line
    scalar body) — inputs the scanner refuses as keys anyway.

    **Corrected at item 228**, in two places.  The residue was written `True`
    everywhere, which made every one of these lemmas a statement that
    `Or.inr trivial` proves; §0 gives the leaf residues their own names.  And
    "taken exactly on a multi-line interior" was imprecise for the separation:
    `[70]`'s comment-delimited arm admits a derivation that crosses no line at
    all (`[79] s-l-comments` has a comment-free arm at column 0 and
    `[63] s-indent(0)` consumes nothing), so that arm and
    `[80] s-separate-in-line` hold at the same zero-width span.

    **Item 230 finishes the separation.**  The arm is not the residue; it is
    an arm, and it keeps its own name (`SepCommentedArm`).  What the
    conversion declines on is `SepResidue` — the span crossed a line, or the
    input ran out — because `[77] b-comment` ends a comment in exactly those
    two ways.  That residue is closed under widening, so it carries out of an
    interior span to an outer one, which is what `True` was standing in for:
    `props_toKey` carries it.

    **Item 231 rebuilds the eighteen motives.**  The eight flow motives carry
    `SepResidue`; the ten block ones stay `True`, because no flow constructor
    mentions a block type and no block motive is ever fed to a flow arm.  Each
    of the 82 declining sites is one `sepResidue_widen` over a fold of the
    arm's OWN piece-suffix facts — §0's lemma, moved there from §4 because §3
    became its heaviest reader.

    **Item 232 exports all eight.**  §3 is a `mutual` block of eight
    structurally recursive lemmas rather than one recursor application, so
    every type of the flow grammar has a conversion of its own and nothing
    here is recovered by INVERTING another conclusion.  `SFlowContent` is the
    one that needed it: `flowContent_toBlockKey` used to wrap its input in
    `SFlowNode.content`, convert, and peel the node back, and the peel has
    four arms the node conversion rules out none of, so its residue could only
    be `True`.  No conclusion in this file ends in `True` now.

    The price is measured, not estimated.  Mutual structural recursion does
    not share a fixpoint: each of the eight is its own `brecOn` over the same
    41 arms, so each carries all 82 declining sites and all 73 widenings, and
    the eight proof terms are the same size to the node
    (`Tests/Guards/Proofs/SurfaceSpanCensus.lean` §5, `exports=8`).  Seven
    more conclusions cost seven more copies of the block.

    The context pairing is tracked as `KeyPair c tc`: the top node converts
    `(flowOut → blockKey)`, interiors `(flowIn → flowKey)`, and `inFlowCtx`
    maps the first onto the second — `isNsPlainSafe` is EQUAL on each pair,
    which is what the plain leaves transport. -/

/-! ## §0 What the conversion declines ON (DOCS item 228)

Each conversion below used to end in `… ∨ True`, and `Or.inr trivial` proves
that whatever is on the left: the statement was not a theorem about the
conversion at all.  These are the residues those `True`s stood for, read off
the arm each proof actually takes.  They are `def`s so the residue carries its
own docstring and so a census can select on it.

They are NOT interchangeable, and that is the finding item 228 recorded and
item 229 proved: three of them consume a line break by construction, so a
consumer holding a single-line key can refute them — which is the entire worth
of a narrowing.  The separation's ARM cannot be refuted that way, and §4 gives
the reason rather than the observation: its span can be EMPTY
(`sepCommentedArm_span_can_be_empty`).  Item 230 replaced it with a residue
that can, at the price of one more hypothesis from the consumer: a key is
followed by a `:`, so the separation did not run the input out. -/

/-- **The arm a separation declines ON**: `[70] s-separate-lines(n)`'s
    comment-delimited arm, for which `[69]`'s key contexts have no production.
    Items 228 and 229 carried this as `sep_toKey`'s residue and item 229
    proved it is not one — §4's two witnesses derive it at spans carrying no
    break, one empty and one three characters long, so no consumer can refute
    it.  It keeps a name because those witnesses are what fixes the shape of
    the residue below. -/
def SepCommentedArm (n : Nat) (s s' : SurfPos) : Prop :=
  ∃ s₁, SSLComments s s₁ ∧ SFlowLinePrefix n s₁ s'

/-- **The residue a separation leaves** (item 230): the span crossed a line,
    or the input ran out.  `[77] b-comment` ends a comment in exactly those
    two ways, so a comment-delimited separation that is not itself inline hits
    one of them — `separateLines_inline_or_breakOrEnd`.  A consumer refutes it
    with the two facts `[193] c-s-implicit-json-key` supplies about everything
    that reaches a `:`: the key crosses no line, and a `:` follows it, so the
    input did not run out. -/
def SepResidue (s s' : SurfPos) : Prop := BreakBetween s s' ∨ atEnd s'

/-- **The residue widens.**  An interior residue is a residue of any span that
    brackets it — the property `True` was standing in for at item 228's
    interior sites.  The outer derivation's constructor gives the two suffix
    facts and `L4YAML/Proofs/Foundation/SurfaceSpan.lean` gives them for all 74
    production types, which is what §3's rebuilt arms spend: item 231 moved
    this lemma up from §4, because every one of `flowNode_toKey`'s 82 declining
    sites is one application of it. -/

    `[134] s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c)` past `[133] ns-plain-one-line(c)`.  Every

    one. -/

  ∃ s₁ s₂ a b, GLit '"' s s₁ ∧ SNbDoubleOneLine s₁ a ∧ SSDoubleBreak n a b ∧

/-- **The residue a single-quoted scalar leaves**: `[125]

    component is `[28] b-break` itself. -/
def SingleResidue (n : Nat) (s s' : SurfPos) : Prop :=

/-! **The three scalar residues each carry a `[28] b-break` inside their span**,
    so each of them IS a `SepResidue` through its left disjunct.  Item 231
    moved these three up from §4: §3's `SFlowContent` arms decline through
    `plain_toKey`, `singleQuoted_toKey` and `doubleQuoted_toKey`, and a
    `SepResidue`-shaped motive needs the bridge at the site. -/

/-! ## §3 The collection family

    The flow grammar is eight types of an 18-type mutual block, so the
    `induction` tactic does not apply — it refuses a mutually inductive type
    outright.  The equation compiler does: `lemma` inside `mutual` is a macro
    in this repo precisely so that it reaches `elabMutual`
    (`L4YAML/Init.lean`), and `L4YAML/Proofs/Foundation/SurfaceSpan.lean` §4
    is eighteen mutually structural lemmas over this same family.

    **Item 232 writes the conversion that way.**  Eight lemmas, one per flow
    type, each `termination_by structural h`, and the ten block types are not
    mentioned at all — the recursion never leaves the flow grammar, so a
    strict subfamily is what the checker is asked to accept, and it does.  The
    pairing is an explicit hypothesis `hp : KeyPair c tc` rather than a
    universally quantified motive, which is what lets a collection's entries
    convert at `inFlowCtx tc` (`hp.inFlow`) while its brackets convert at
    `tc`.

    Item 231 wrote it as ONE application of the family's recursor with
    eighteen motives.  That is the shape that hands back one conclusion for
    the price of all 69 minor premises, and the seven it does not hand back
    are what item 232 is for.

    Every interior piece converts or the whole conversion returns `True`.
    That `True` is the one item 228 could not replace: the residue belongs to
    an interior span and this conclusion is about the outer one, so the
    proposition that would carry it out is a statement about the CHARACTERS
    between the two.  The 18 types below have 69 constructors, and at item 228
    not one lemma related any of them to a suffix; item 229 wrote all
    eighteen, and item 230 gave the separation a residue that widens along
    them (`props_toKey` is the first conclusion to carry one out of an
    interior span).

    **Item 231 spent that mechanically**, and the shape is uniform: every
    constructor is a chain of pieces `s = p₀ → … → p_k = s'`, a declining site
    sits at piece `i` holding `SepResidue pᵢ pᵢ₊₁`, and the two facts
    `sepResidue_widen` wants are the folds `chain(0…i-1)` and
    `chain(i+1…k-1)` of the arm's other pieces' suffix lemmas.  Nothing in an
    arm is chosen: the `have`s below are exactly the pieces some chain reads,
    which is why the three arms that decline nowhere (`SFlowNode.alias`,
    `SFlowSeqEntry.emptyKeyEmpty`, `SFlowMapEntry.emptyKeyEmpty`) carry none.
    Item 232 kept all of it — the same 41 arms, the same 82 sites, the same
    105 `have`s — and changed only who calls whom: an interior premise reads
    its OWN lemma where it used to read an induction hypothesis.

    The three `SFlowContent` scalar arms are the one place the residue is not
    already a `SepResidue`: `plain_toKey`, `singleQuoted_toKey` and
    `doubleQuoted_toKey` return their own, and each is bridged by its §0
    `*_break` lemma into the left disjunct. -/

/-! ## §4 What the narrowing buys (DOCS item 229)

Item 228 narrowed six conclusions and could not say whether the narrowing was
worth anything: a residue is worth exactly what a consumer can refute
(`Tests.Guards.ConclusionObligationCensus.conclusion_eliminable_iff`), and
refuting "some interior crossed a line" needs the span — the characters
between the conclusion's own two positions — which the library could not name.
`L4YAML/Proofs/Foundation/SurfaceSpan.lean` names it, so the four residues can
now be sorted by the only question that matters.

Three carry a `[28] b-break` inside their span, so `¬ BreakBetween s s'`
refutes them — `plainResidue_break`, `doubleResidue_break` and
`singleResidue_break`, which live in §0 since item 231 made §3's scalar arms
their first readers.  The separation's ARM does not, and the two witnesses below are
the proof, not the observation: item 228's zero-width derivation has an EMPTY
span, and the `[77] b-comment` `eof` derivation has a three-character span
with no break in it, so no predicate on the span distinguishes the arm from a
separation that was never taken.

**Item 230 reads the same two witnesses forwards.**  `[77]` ends a comment
with a break OR at the end of the input, and those are the only two ways; so
the statement that IS a residue is `SepResidue` — `BreakBetween s s' ∨
atEnd s'` — and `sep_toKey` now returns the LEFT disjunct on the zero-width
derivation (`sep_toKey_left_at_zero_width`).  The second witness is the one
that forces `atEnd` into the residue: it is a comment-delimited separation
that crosses no line and is NOT inline. -/


/-- **The arm's span can be empty**, so no character predicate refutes it.
    This is `sepCommentedArm_of_startOfLine` read through the span: item 228 showed
    the arm and its own left disjunct hold together, and the reason is that
    the derivation consumes nothing at all. -/
lemma sepCommentedArm_span_can_be_empty (chars : List Char) :
    SepCommentedArm 0 ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ ∧ ¬ BreakBetween ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ := by

    simp only [Span] at hspan
    simpa using hspan.symm
  exact absurd (hpre ▸ hmem) (by simp)

/-- **…and it can be non-empty and still cross no line.**  `[77] b-comment`
    ends a comment at END OF INPUT as well as at a break, so ` #c<EOF>` is a
    comment-delimited separation whose span is three characters, none of them a
    break.  Together with `sepCommentedArm_span_can_be_empty` this is why no
    predicate on the span refutes the ARM — not `BreakBetween`, and not "the
    span contains a `#`" either, since the zero-width witness has neither.

    It is also the derivation that keeps `atEnd` in `SepResidue`:
    `sepCommentedArm_at_eof_comment_not_inline` shows this span is not an
    inline separation, so the trichotomy's third disjunct is not slack. -/

/-! ### The payment

`narrowed_conclusion_pays` (item 228's §1) with the residue discharged: a
consumer holding "this key's span crosses no line" — which is what
`[193] c-s-implicit-json-key` requires of everything that reaches a `:` —
gets the conversion outright, with no disjunction left to case on.  The
separation's payment needs one more fact from the same consumer, and it is
one a key always has: the `:` that made it a key is still in the input, so
the separation did not run the input out. -/
