# Block-scalar-in-flow guard: proof helpers (DOCS item 9c) — legacy scanner

`scanNextToken_dispatchContent`'s `|`/`>` arm is guarded by `s.inFlow`:
`c-l+literal` [170] and `c-l+folded` [174] are reachable only through
`s-l+block-node` [196], and `ns-flow-content` [158] offers plain, flow-seq,
flow-map, single- and double-quoted only — so a block-scalar header inside a
flow collection has no derivation and the scanner rejects it with
`ScanError.blockScalarInFlow`.

The guard sits *inside* the arm rather than at the head of the dispatcher, so
only the `|`/`>` arm changed shape.  Downstream proofs that used to read
`h : scanBlockScalar s = .ok s'` straight off the arm now read the guarded
form; `blockScalarGuard_elim` restores the pre-guard equation and, for free,
the `s.inFlow = false` the guard establishes.

This mirrors `FlowAdjacency.peel_flowAdj`: an *inversion* helper for the sites
that consume a successful dispatch, plus a *construction* helper
(`blockScalarGuard_ok_of_notInFlow`) for the sites that build one.

The indexed twin needs no such helper: its guard is folded into the existing
header check as `blockScalarPreErrIx`, so its arm keeps the exact `split`
sequence it had before item 9c.

/-! ## Inversion (peel the guard off a successful arm) -/

/-- A successful guarded block-scalar arm gives back **both** halves of the
    guard: the flow context was block (`s.inFlow = false` — the `.error` branch
    cannot equal `.ok`), and the underlying `scanBlockScalar` succeeded. -/

/-! ## The dispatcher-level fact (what β.3's content step consumes)

`dispatchContent_evidence` hands the flow-interior content step an
`SFlowNode`-shaped disjunction that still offers `SCLLiteral ∨ SCLFolded`.
Inside a flow collection those two are underivable, and the lemma below is
what says so *about the scanner*: at depth ≥ 1 a successful content dispatch
cannot have been on a block-scalar header, so the literal/folded disjuncts are
refutable rather than merely unwelcome.  This is the whole point of item 9c —
before the guard, the arm was not refutable at all. -/
