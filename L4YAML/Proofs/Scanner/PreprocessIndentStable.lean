# The indent stack across preprocessing (DOCS item 27)

Item 26 left the indented block scalar one inequality short of composing:
`[170] c-l+literal(n)` reads at every `n ≤ d`, where `d` is the indent the
scanner collected the body at, and the scanner's own floor for `d` is
`(max 0 (currentIndent + 1)).toNat` — so the accumulator owes
`(n : Int) ≤ currentIndent + 1` for the entry index it parked.  That is true of
every accepted input and was unstatable, because `currentIndent` occurred in the
accumulation invariant exactly zero times.

Carrying it on the pending is only half the job: the pending is parked at the
INDICATOR's state and consumed at the VALUE's, one preprocessing step later, so
the fact has to survive `scanNextToken_preprocess`.  It does not survive
unconditionally — that is what `unwindIndents` is for — but it survives exactly
when the step crossed no break, which is the same discriminant every other
break-free reading in `StreamAccum` already splits on:

    scanNextToken_preprocess s
      = skipToContent s ⟩⟩ (if !inFlow && needIndentCheck then unwindIndents … else id)
        ⟩⟩ saveSimpleKey

`skipToContent` never touches `indents` (it only walks the cursor and raises
`needIndentCheck`), and `saveSimpleKey` only pushes tokens — so the ONLY writer
is the armed `unwindIndents`, and the arming flag is `s_content.needIndentCheck`.
This module proves the walk half of that (`skipToContent_preserves_indents`, by
the mechanical descent the `_preserves_flowLevel` family already makes over the
same five functions) and then the preprocessing statement conditioned on the
flag being down at the point of the test.

Kept out of `ScannerCorrectness` deliberately: that module is imported by
essentially everything, and this is a leaf the accumulator alone reads.

The loop only POPS, and it stops as soon as the top is at or left of the
column it is unwinding to.  Two consequences are all the accumulator needs:
either nothing was popped and the stack is UNCHANGED, or the size strictly
dropped — which is the very condition preprocessing's own trailing-content
check tests, so an accepted input tells the caller which case it is in. -/

/-! ## §1c  Where the unwind STOPS (item 127)

§1b says whether the loop popped.  This says where it came to rest, which is the
scanner half of the frames ↔ indent-stack coupling (DOCS's U3): the loop runs
until the top of the stack is at or left of the column it is unwinding to, so a
landing that popped anything and survived preprocessing's own trailing-content
check sits EXACTLY at an open level's column — not merely at or below one.  That
is stronger than the membership `ResumeFrames.resumeAt` asks for, and it is the
fact a coupled frames field would spend.

The one escape is the sentinel: a loop that pops to a one-entry stack rests on
`{ column := -1 }`, which no landing column can equal.  It is named here rather
than discharged, because ruling it out is a statement about the incoming stack
(`ScannerState.WellFormed`'s sixth conjunct) that the accumulation does not
carry. -/

/-- The loop stops on its own GUARD, not on its fuel, whenever it is given at
    least as much fuel as the stack has entries — each iteration pops one, and
    the guard already refuses to pop the last.  So the result satisfies the

The statement the accumulator actually reads is not here but in
`preprocess_some_ssl_comments_anyCol` (`StreamAccum`), because the flag the
unwind branch tests is `skipToContent`'s OWN result, not the caller's: the flag
can go UP during the walk (a break sets it), and the fact that it did not is
exactly the surface no-break disjunct that lemma already returns.  So the two
travel together — §1's `skipToContent_preserves_indents` plus §2's key save
discharge the payload's new conjunct there, and the armed branch is refuted by
the same flag transparency item 12's payload already uses. -/

/-! ## §4  From the stack to the floor

`currentIndent` is the stack's top column, so an equal stack is an equal indent;
and the scanner's block-scalar floor is `(max 0 (currentIndent + 1)).toNat`, so
the accumulator's carried `(n : Int) ≤ currentIndent + 1` is exactly what says
the entry's index is one the body's content indent admits. -/

lemma currentIndent_of_indents_eq {s t : ScannerState} (h : s.indents = t.indents) :
    s.currentIndent = t.currentIndent := by

    `scanBlockScalarBody`'s `minContentIndent`, and `scanBlockScalar_prod_at`
    concludes that the indent the body was actually collected at is at least
    this.  So it is the largest index an entry can sit at and still have its
    `[170]`/`[174]` body read at that index. -/

/-- **What a pending owes if its index is to survive into a block scalar.**

    Two decidable facts about the scanner state the pending is parked at: the
    indent-check flag is down (so the next preprocessing step cannot unwind the
    stack out from under the index — §3), and the index is at or below the
    floor a block scalar's body would be collected against (§4).

    It is carried as `IndentFloor sc n ∨ True`, exactly as items 15/17 carry
    `ImplicitKeyPack` / `PropsKeyPack`: a producer that can measure it hands the
    left side over, one that cannot hands `True`, and the CONSUMER's route to
    the escape is unchanged either way.  So the escape's call-site count is
    fixed by construction and what the item moves is the domain (R645/R646). -/

`colon_open_map` parks — the key sits at the `:` itself and the push is at the

/-! ## §6c  The `:` producer, measured at the KEY instead of at itself

Item 27 read `scanValuePrepare`'s push at the INDICATOR's column, which is the
key's own only when the save was fresh, and punted otherwise.  Item 28 measures
the same push at the column it actually uses — `s.simpleKey.pos.col`, the
resolved key's — so an entry whose index is at or below the KEY is bounded
whether the save was fresh or inherited.  The two arms need no case split
between them: the arm that pushes lands the stack top exactly at the key, and
the arm that does not push was gated by `keyCol ≤ currentIndent`, which is the
same inequality already.

The EXPLICIT-key clear (`scanValueClearKey`, `[197]`'s arm) stopped punting at
item 81: both of its branches demand things a live same-line key that sits
strictly behind the cursor cannot supply — branch (2) a key from the `?`'s own
earlier line, branch (1) a key saved AT the `:` itself — and
`KeysBehindCursor` (ScannerCorrectness) says every reachable saved key IS
strictly behind.  `scanValueClearKey_keyrun` names the pair, and the floor
lemmas below take the two coordinates as premises and return the floor
unconditionally. -/

/-- **The clear is a no-op unless the key it clears sat AT the cursor.**
    `scanValueClearKey`'s two branches both need the `:` on a different line

    impossible and the first names the offset it cleared. -/

case rather than assuming it away: `scanKey` pushes only in block context, and

/-! ## §7  A tab in the indentation refuses, in every arm (DOCS item 32)

`[63] s-indent(n)` is spaces only, and all three block indicators stand
directly after one — `[184]`'s own entry for `-`, `[191]`'s for `?`, and for a
keyless `:` either `[192]`'s `e-node` entry or `[195]`'s explicit value.  Each
scanner says so, and this is the form the accumulator's tab branch reads: a
successful dispatch is impossible.  The `-` arm has carried its scan since Step
5b.2, the `?` and `:` arms since item 31. -/

/-- `?` and `-` read the run in front of the indicator (`[66]`'s walk); `:`

/-! ## §8  …and in front of a COMPACT `:`, from the run (DOCS item 34)

§7 refutes the tab from `[63] s-indent`'s own coordinate — `tabInLineIndent`,
the whole line in front of the token — and that coordinate answers `false` for a
COMPACT indicator by design: `- →: a` has the entry's `-` on the line, so the
line-walk stops there and reports "something precedes this token", which is
true and is not the question.  The question is whether the run BETWEEN the two
indicators is `[185] s-l+block-indented`'s `s-indent(m)`, and that run is what
`[66]`'s backward scan reads.

`scanBlockEntry` and `scanKey` read it directly (§7's two `_tab_ne`s, which need
nothing but the run).  `scanValue` consults the simple-key machine first, and
the branch it takes is not the one the shape suggests: on the indicator's own
line preprocessing has just SAVED a key at the `:` itself — every block
indicator's scan leaves `simpleKeyAllowed := true`, and a break-free step never
clears it — so the key branch walks back from the same offset the fallback
branch would.  Both read the run; the run has a tab; the scan throws either way.

That is the whole content of the two lemmas below: a `:` whose recorded key, if
any, sits AT the cursor cannot be scanned over a tabbed run. -/

/-- The `-` scan re-arms fresh saves.  This is what puts a recorded key at the
    NEXT indicator when nothing intervenes, and so what sends the `:` scan's
    tab test to the run in front of it. -/
