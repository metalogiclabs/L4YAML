/-! # `allowDirectives` across preprocessing (β.3)

    `scanNextToken_preprocess` runs `skipToContent`, `unwindIndents` and
    `saveSimpleKey`, none of which touches `allowDirectives`.  This file walks
    that chain so `preprocess_preserves_allowDirectives` is available to the
    accumulation.

    **Why it is needed.**  `scanNextToken` clears `allowDirectives` on the first
    non-structural token, and every flow indicator is dispatched *after* that
    clear — so an open flow collection implies the flag is already false.  The
    accumulation carries that as part of its flow-interior invariant, and
    `accum_step_structural` consumes it: `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural`'s
    only success arm inside a flow is the `%` directive, and `scanDirective`
    rejects outright when `allowDirectives` is false.  Without this transport the
    invariant would be stated on `sc` and needed on `s_prep`.

    Structurally these are the `_preserves_flowStack` walks of
    `Proofs/Scanner/ScannerFlowStackPreservation.lean` with the field renamed:
    the proofs are field-agnostic (unfold + split + fuel induction bottoming out
    in `emit`/`advance`), so they transfer verbatim.  Only the preprocessing
    prefix is cloned — the scan-body collectors are not on this path. -/

/-! ## No structural token succeeds inside an open flow (β.3)

    `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural` returns `.ok (some _)` from exactly three
    arms, and inside a flow collection all three are dead:

    * the `---` and `...` accept arms sit BELOW the §5.4 `documentMarkerInFlow`
      guard, which fires on precisely their trigger once `inFlow` holds;
    * the `%` arm reaches `scanDirective`, which rejects on `!allowDirectives`.

    The flag is false inside a flow because `scanNextToken` clears it before any
    flow indicator is dispatched, so the `[`/`{` that opened the collection
    cleared it. The accumulation carries that fact; this lemma consumes it. -/

/-! ## The two indicator dispatchers (item 138)

    `scanNextToken` clears `allowDirectives` before either indicator dispatcher
    runs, and neither dispatcher's scans touch the flag again.  Walking them is
    what turns that clear into a park FIELD: every `PendingNode` produced past
    the structural dispatch carries `sc.allowDirectives = false`, which is how a
    later `%` — the one arm `scanDirective` admits — knows the park it closed
    was the stream's own seed or a `...`.

    The proofs are the file's own shape: unfold, split on the guards, and bottom
    out in `emit`/`advance`, neither of which writes the field. -/
