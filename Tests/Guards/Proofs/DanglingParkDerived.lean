/-! # The dangling park, derived at the producer (DOCS item 156)

Item 141 built the CONSUMER half of §9.2's dangling refusal —
`danglingNode_refutes_landing` and `danglingNode_refutes_eof`, in
`StreamDanglingParkRevocable` — and left the producer half unnamed: nothing in
the library said what a content dispatch's park READS.  This file is that half,
landed in `StreamAccum` and exercised here.

The chain is the token array's own, and every link is now a lemma:

* `dispatchContent_tokens_push` — off `&` and `!`, every content arm pushes
  exactly ONE node body, and pushes it at the dispatch's own `currentPos`
  (the block scalar included, through `scanBlockScalar_tokens_push`);
* `trailingNodeRun?_push_body` — a body pushed on top starts a trailing run of
  one, with the array's own last REAL slot as its predecessor
  (`prevRealIdx?_push`, `prevRealIdx?_lt`);
* `CompletedTail.danglingPred` — a completed node tail offers the next run no
  slot, because `completesFlowValue` and `offersNodeSlot` are disjoint;
* `danglingPark_of_dispatch` — so the park reads `some ⟨line, col⟩` at the
  landing's own column, whenever that column names an open level;
* `danglingPark_refutes_landing` / `danglingPark_refutes_eof` — spent against
  the two §9.2 checks.

§1 reads the chain's premises and its conclusion off the real scanner, over the
family item 141 named.  §2 is the correction this item makes to item 144's
attribution, at its type and over its own three witnesses.  §3 is the
correction to item 141's corpus.  §4 is the face, re-priced.  §5 is the wall,
re-confirmed with its witness. -/

/-! ## §1  The chain, read off the real scanner

Item 141's six-member family, at the landing that MAKES the park.  Every member
reads the lemma's premises — an open level at the dispatch's column, a last real
token that offers no slot — and every one gets the lemma's conclusion: `some` at
that same column.  The last two are this file's own additions, a sequence entry
and a plain value, so the family is not one shape. -/

/-! ## §2  What the face does NOT reach — item 144's attribution, corrected

Item 144 measured that `content_dispatch_after_close` cannot pay §9.2's landing
guard and recorded the residue as "row 19's 1c residue for the indented family —
**item 141's park face**".  The first half is right and the attribution is not:
the face reads `none` at all three of that lemma's callers, so it can never
refute them, and the three inputs are VALID.

The reason is structural, not a measurement, and it holds at the type — with
item 177's floor it is the COLUMN's, not the slot's: the three callers park at
landings indented strictly past every open level (the witness rows below read
`op=false`), and a run whose column names no open level reads `none` on either
side of the exemption.  The slot's own exemption survives only for the run
shapes other readings refuse (a `[96]`-headed run is the parser's
`trailingContent`, a flow-close tail is item 172's floor), because the offered
slot cannot reach the level's own column — `s-separate(n+1)`, Finding A's
floor. -/

/-! ## §3  Item 141's corpus, corrected

Item 141's census walked "the 490 `.yaml` files in `yaml-test-suite/src` and
`examples/`" and recorded **2275** observations: 2 `R`, 0 `E`, 2273 `D`.  Item
145 re-ran it and recorded every cell unchanged.  Both readings are over the
wrong files on the suite side: `yaml-test-suite/src/*.yaml` are test
DESCRIPTORS, each a root sequence of mappings — the correction item 155 made to
item 154's own census, made again here.

Re-walked with the same instrument, the 490 files read as:

| corpus | obs | `R` | `E` | `D` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the 490 files, walked as payloads (item 141's reading) | 2275 | 2 | 0 | 2273 |
| the suite's 406 extracted payloads | 183 | 6 | 6 | 171 |
| `examples/`, which are payloads already | 163 | 2 | 0 | 161 |

So the honest corpus is **346** observations, **14** of them discharge-able (8
`R` + 6 `E`) and **332** carried — 4.0 %, not item 141's 0.09 %.  The
descriptor sweep manufactured about 1 930 of its observations out of its own
nested mappings, and it hid all six of the `E`s, because a descriptor file never
ends on a dangling run.

**The structural conclusion is unchanged**, and it never rested on the census:
what decides the face's shape is §2's revocability measurement, which is over
hand-built inputs.  What the census decides is how HOT the carried disjunct is,
and at 96 % it is still the language rather than a corner of it. -/

/-! ## §4  The face, re-priced

Stated as a PREMISE rather than as item 141's conclusion-disjunct —
`h_closable : danglingNodePos? sc = none → ∀ sp_mid, …`, with
`PendingNode.close_with_ssl` taking the same premise — the face is **32**
distinct sites in **9** holders at the tree this item stands on:

| holder | sites |
|---|---|
| `accum_content_pending` | 11 |
| `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented` | 6 |
| `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue` | 5 |
| `content_dispatch_routed` | 4 |
| `accum_step_flow` | 2 |
| `eof_pending`, `accum_structural_pending`, `accum_flow_open_depth0`, `accum_block_pending` | 1 each |

Item 141 priced the conclusion-disjunct shape at 19 → 28 → 32 over three waves
(14 producers, 5 consumers).  The producer count is the same 14; the five
consumers are the same five, one site each, and they are the last four rows
above plus `accum_content_pending`'s own.  The premise shape reaches 32 in one
wave because it never widens a conclusion — which is why it is the shape this
file records. -/

/-! ## §5  The wall, re-confirmed

Four of the five consumers stand where §9.2 gives a refutation: `eof_pending`
at `scanLoop_checkDanglingNode`, which is gated on nothing, and the three
landing consumers at `scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode`, gated on the break the
landing crossed.  `accum_block_pending` does not: its `h_close_pending` is built
BEFORE the case split, and its live arm is a `:` on the park's own line, where
the flag is DOWN and the check stands aside by construction.

Item 141's punting witness is still the one that makes this real rather than
structural — an ALIAS key, which `pendingContent.h_key` does not pack, so the
`:` reaches `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`'s fallback with a dangling park in
hand.  It scans clean and it parses. -/

#guard chainAt "a: &x 1\n*x : 2\n" 4 == "col=0 op=true pred=no-slot park=1,0"

-- The gating, at its type, restated here because it is what §5 turns on: with
-- the flag DOWN the mid-stream check succeeds on a state whose reading is
-- `some`, so `danglingPark_refutes_landing` has no premise to be given.
