/-! # The adjacent-value refusal (DOCS item 47)

`scanNextToken_checkAdjacentValue` refuses a `:` that fell through
`isValueCandidate` while the line still belongs to a completed node: the last
real token completes a value and no structural break has re-armed
`simpleKeyAllowed`.  Read as a `[126]` plain head, that `:` would start a
SECOND node in a slot `[194]` gives exactly one — `"a" :b` has no derivation.

The condition's two conjuncts are exactly what the parked accumulation
invariant carries (`StaleNodeTail`), which is what lets the content parks'
`:`-residue arms refute the check's success instead of deferring.  The
simple-key state is deliberately NOT consulted: `:foo: v` at a line start is
a legal `:`-headed plain KEY after a completed entry (yaml-test-suite 2EBW),
and the break that re-arms `simpleKeyAllowed` is what separates it from the
glued families below.

§1 pins the refused family (was scanner-accepted parser-refused — row 19's
over-acceptance, closed by item 47).  §2 pins the preserved neighbours on
every side of the condition's three conjuncts. -/

/-! ## §2  The preserved neighbours, one per conjunct

The `:` that IS the value indicator (blank-followed → `isValueCandidate`,
never reaches the check); the `:`-headed plain at a node-head position (the
last real token does not complete a value); and the line-start `:`-key (a
break re-armed `simpleKeyAllowed`). -/

-- 2EBW's shape: the `:`-headed plain KEY at a line start, after a completed
-- entry — the break re-armed the flag, so the check stays out of the way.
#guard accepts "?foo: safe question mark\n:foo: safe colon\n-foo: safe dash\n"
-- Cross-line glued `:` after a completed node is NOT the scanner's to refuse
-- (the flag is re-armed); it stays the parser's `bareDocumentContent`.
