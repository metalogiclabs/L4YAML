# `refLex` against `parseYaml` — the capstone's two sides on fixed inputs

`EVENTSOF-CONCEPT.md` §6 Q2: with `eventsOf` executable, the restated
capstone's right-hand conjunct `SerializationWellFormed (eventsOf input)` can
be compared with `parseYaml`'s verdict BEFORE any proof is attempted.  Each
row pins both readings.  A disagreement would be a finding, not a failure; on
this tree every row agrees, including the three `&x` self-descendant shapes
(5a(iv): the token parser's declaration set accepts what YAML 1.2.2 §3.2.2.2
admits).  Shape-only rejections are `ExactSurfaceLanguage`'s business.
