/-! # §8.1's OTHER half — the floor inside an open flow collection (DOCS item 69)

The flow OPEN spends `scanNextToken_checkBlockFlowIndent`, which is guarded on
`!inFlow` and so says nothing once a collection is open (item 66).  The half
that runs INSIDE one is `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural`'s, and it is both
wider and narrower: it refuses EVERY character at or left of `currentIndent`,
not just `[` and `{`.  That is what refutes the run-END half of a flow-interior
separator whose landing under-runs the stack's reading index.

* §1 the refusal, at each frame transition the interior takes: a `,` entry, a
  close, a nested open, a flushed `[96]` run, and the `?`/`:` key routes — with
  the reading one column right beside it.
* §2 the floor is the ENCLOSING block's `currentIndent + 1`, so it moves: at
  the top level nothing under-runs and a continuation at column 0 reads.
* §3 the TAB half, which the same landing can take instead.  §6.1 refuses it
  too; the proof does not yet, because refuting it needs the flow park's own
  column — so these pin what the next increment has to reach.

ZERO runtime edits: every pin below behaved this way before item 69 too. -/

-- §1 The enclosing block map sits at indent 2, so `currentIndent` is 1 and the
-- collection reads its interior at 2 — a landing at 2 is at the floor and
-- refused, one column right it composes.

-- (b) a CLOSE — item 50: `]` and `}` are content of the same node and clear
-- the same floor.
#guard errAt "k:\n  a: [1,\n  ]\n" == some (2, 2)
#guard emits "k:\n  a: [1,\n   ]\n"

-- own reason, so only the floor's refusal is pinned there).

-- §2 The floor is the ENCLOSING block's, so it moves with it.  At the top
-- level `currentIndent` is -1 and the reading index is 0, where a landing
-- cannot under-run at all; under a `- ` entry it is 0, so column 0 is refused
-- and column 1 reads.

-- §3 The TAB half of the same landing: §6.1 refuses it at or left of the
