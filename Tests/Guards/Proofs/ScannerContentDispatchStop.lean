/-! # The content dispatch's own stop-set reading (DOCS item 42)

Items 36 and 37 read the parked line facts — `[204]`'s `TailSuffix` after a
`...`, §7.5's `NodeStop` after a complete node — against the BLOCK dispatch,
where the three indicators had to be refuted one by one from the validators'
allowlists.  At the CONTENT dispatch the same facts meet a different partner:
the dispatch's own character class.  `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` returns
`.ok` only on the seven construct heads (`&`, `*`, `!`, `|`, `>`, `"`, `'`)
or a `[126] ns-plain-first` character, and that class contains no break, no
`#`, no non-printable and no BOM (`dispatchContent_ok_charFacts`).

So the two arms close by intersection rather than by enumeration:

* a `...` park's line stops at a break or a `#` (`TailSuffix`), the dispatch
  accepts neither — the arm is EMPTY (`docEnd_refutes_content_residue`);
* a complete node's line stops at `NodeStop`, and the intersection with the
  dispatch's class is exactly `[154]`'s `:` with a non-blank follower
  (`nodeStop_content_residue_is_colon`) — which the scanner refuses at the
  dispatch boundary (`scanNextToken_checkAdjacentValue`, item 47): read as a
  `[126]` plain-scalar head it would be a SECOND node in a one-node slot,
  and no production derives one.

§1 pins the `...` side: every same-line content head dies at the marker's own
scan (`trailingContentAfterDocEnd`), the `s-l-comments` tail is accepted, and
a `...` with content glued to it never scans a marker at all ([206]
`c-forbidden` wants a break, a white, or the end of input after the `...`, so
the plain walk absorbs the line).  §2 pins the node side: every content head
but the `:` dies at the node's own trailing validation, the `#` that reaches
the dispatch with `commentOk` down dies AT the dispatch, and the glued `:`
dies at the adjacent-value check — one character from the legal `[154]` form,
refused where `isValueCandidate` fell through (item 47).

/-! ## §1  `[204]`: nothing follows a `...` but its own comment tail

Every content head on the marker's line is refused by `scanDocumentEnd`
itself, before any park exists — which is exactly why the accumulator's arm
has nothing to serve. -/

Every other content head is refused by the completed node's own trailing

-- own refutation observed at runtime.

-- non-blank follower after a completed node would read as a plain-scalar
-- head — a second node in a one-node slot — and
