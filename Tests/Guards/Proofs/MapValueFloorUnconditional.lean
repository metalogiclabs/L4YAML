/-! # `pendingMapValue`'s floor is unconditional (DOCS item 82)

Reflection 653 §3 priced the field optional because the implicit `:` pushes at
the RESOLVED key's column, which the producer could not measure.  Items 79–81
made it measurable — the pack's column is an equation, the inherit is the
consumer's derivation, and `[197]`'s clear dies on `KeysBehindCursor` — so the
field is `IndentFloor sc n` outright: all six producers pay it, and the flow
OPEN's under-run arms refute from it directly, DELETING the two drop rides
`pendingMapValue` still carried there (`k:⏎  b:⏎[1]`'s run-end half and its
tab half).  What still rides at the open is `pendingFlow`'s opaque resume (R3)
and the props park's two arms (the next item's).

§1 pins the types; §2 measures the floor's inequality at every implicit `:`.

/-- ...and `colon_open_map_implicit`'s slot asks for exactly that. -/
example {s' : ScannerState} {k : Nat} (h : IndentFloor s' k) :
    IndentFloor s' k := h

/-! ## §2  The measurement: the push lands at or above the resolved key

At every block-context `:` that resolves a live same-line key at column `k`,
the state after the scan has `k ≤ currentIndent` — `scanValue_key_col_le`'s
inequality, read off the running scanner.  `floorSeen` counts the states
where the premise fires, so the check is measured, not vacuous. -/
