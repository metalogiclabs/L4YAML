/-! # The compact collection composes on the indicator's own line (DOCS item 33)

Row 12's inline residue is a mid-line park that crosses no break, so
`[79] s-l-comments` — the evidence every close in the accumulation spends — does
not exist there and cannot be manufactured.  Item 19 called the family
irreducible on those grounds and it was, for the arms that were looking: every
close-and-reopen route goes through a landing.

What the SPEC offers instead is a production none of those arms names.
`[185] s-l+block-indented(n,c)` has four alternatives and the accumulation had
consumers for two of them (`s-l+block-node` and `e-node s-l-comments`).  The
other two are

    s-indent(m) ns-l-compact-sequence(n+1+m)
    s-indent(m) ns-l-compact-mapping(n+1+m)

and they ask for no comments at all, because a compact collection HAS no line of
its own — it shares the entry indicator's.  That is exactly the shape of the
input the residue is looking at.

So the residue at a `-`-parked pending is not a weaker landing case; it is a
different `[185]` alternative, and the whites the step left in front of the new
indicator are its `s-indent(m)` — the same run item 22 reads at a landing,
through the same splitter.

Two things are worth pinning beyond the shapes themselves.

* **The index is `n+1+m`.** Both constructors said `n+m` — off by the column the
  entry indicator occupies — for as long as they had no producer and no
  consumer, which is to say since they were written.  Nothing could disagree
  with an index nothing instantiates.  At `n+m` the SIBLINGS of a compact entry
  are required one column to the left of where the input puts them, so
  `- - a⏎  - b` (§2) is the pin that would have caught it.
* **The compact pending is an ORDINARY one.** `- - a` parks `pendingBlock` at
  the inner index and `- : a` parks `pendingMapValue`, so everything downstream
  — the sibling snoc, the nested open, the value readings of items 23–29 — fires
  again one level in without knowing it is inside a compact collection.

§4 pins the boundary: a tab in the compact `s-indent(m)` is refused, which is
the same §6.1 rule §3 of `ScannerTabBeforeBlockEntry` records one production up.

`ns-l-compact-sequence(N)`'s later entries are `s-indent(N) c-l-block-seq-entry`,
so a sibling of the compact entry stands at column `N = n+1+m` — the column the
compact `-` itself is at.  These are the pins that fix the arithmetic. -/

/-! ## §4  The tab, one production down

`[185]`'s `s-indent(m)` is `[63] s-indent`, so it is spaces — a tab in the run
between the entry indicator and the compact one was used as indentation, and
§6.1 forbids it.  The scanner refuses all three, from `[66]`'s backward scan
(items 31/32's checks, reached here from a run that is NOT the whole line). -/

#guard refuses "-\t- a\n"
#guard refuses "- \t- a\n"
#guard refuses "- \t? a\n"
#guard refuses "- \t: a\n"
#guard refuses "- \t\t: a\n"
#guard refuses "?\t- a\n"
#guard refuses ": \t- a\n"
#guard refuses "- - \t- a\n"

/-! ## §5  What this item does NOT reach, and both are still accepted

`- a: 1` is a compact mapping too, and the commonest one in the language, but
its `:` arrives with the entry's content ALREADY parked (`pendingBlockContent`),
so re-reading that content as `[193]`'s implicit key is item 25's pack on a
different pending — a different obstruction, not a harder case of this one.

Sibling compact-mapping entries (`- : a⏎  : b`) close and re-open through
`[211]`'s document continuation rather than through `[195]`'s tail, because
`pendingMapValue` carries no entries-level closure — the same
over-approximation `: a⏎: b` has ridden since item 13 (action row 19). -/
