/-! # The flow frame's resume rider (DOCS item 120)

Item 111 gave `PropsKeyPack` the two resume twins (items 99/108's entry-level
faces) and named the ONE boundary that still dropped them: the flow open's
props arm, where `FlowBaseRoutes.key` carried the value-line pair only — so a
props-headed flow KEY at a RESUMED landing lost its context's holdings across
the collection, and the park the landed `:` opened had punts where the
enclosing levels' faces belonged.

**The rider**: `FlowBaseRoutes.key` gains the two twins beside the pair
(stated at the key's own entry, exactly `ImplicitKeyPack`'s shapes), the
props arm passes its pack's own through — the pack's domain `(k, sp_p)` IS
the frame's `(k, sp_key)`, so the hand-off is verbatim — and
`flowKeyPack_of_close` hands them into the pack it builds, replacing the two
`Or.inr trivial`s items 99/108 had left there.  `flowKeyRoute_of_root` /
`flowKeyRoute_of_open` punt the new conjuncts: their routes end in the CLOSED
stream, and the bare flow key at an open level's own column is §8.1-refused
(`flow content under-indented`, §1's boundary pins) — the props head is what
makes the family reachable, which is why the props arm is the one payment.

**This is the 67b piece that was committable.**  The DELETION proper —
`pendingFlow`, `scannerDrop`, `dropClose`, `close_with_ssl`'s arm,
`block_dispatch_deferred`'s three sites — stays blocked: the two
inline-residue defer sites still PRODUCE the pending whenever the key packs
punt, and the punts that remain are `KeyPackPunt.dedent` (R4's landing pad,
by design) and `noKeyContext`, which has no named input (items 101/104/105's
measured chain).  §4 pins the counts so the blockage is measured, not
assumed.  (Two names have since left this list: `noFrame` with item 125, and
`FlowStackB.shape` with item 126, which measured the collapse unreachable.) -/

/-! ## §4  The deletion proper, measured blocked

The escape's three `block_dispatch_deferred` applications and the one
`dropClose` use stand exactly where items 116–118 left them (the counts are
re-measured in DOCS item 120); the two inline-residue sites still produce
`pendingFlow` off `KeyPackPunt`'s surviving reasons.  `dedent` is R4's
landing pad by design; `noKeyContext` has NO named input (item 104) and its
constructor's deletion is the under-indent invariant's spend — `noFrame`'s
was paid at item 125.  So the rest of 67b — the constructor, `scannerDrop`,
`dropClose`, `close_with_ssl`'s arm — waits on that item, not on this one.
(`FlowStackB.shape` left the list at item 126, unreachable and deleted.) -/
