/-! # The break-crossed block dispatch composes (DOCS item 19)

Items 13–17 composed the block arms whose PENDING was parked at column 0.  A
pending parked mid-line — after `a` in `- a`, after `]` in `- [1]`, after the
indicator in a bare `-` — reaches the very same column-0 line start by crossing
a break, and every one of those arms is anchored at the landing, not at the
park.  Item 19 gates them on the landing instead
(`preprocess_some_ssl_comments_landing`, the join of the column-0 and
crossed-break producers of one package), so the multi-line block sequence — the
commonest shape in the language — leaves the deferral: `- a⏎- b` snocs through
`h_entry_old` exactly as a column-0 park does, and a break-crossed `:` opens
`[189]`'s empty-key entry exactly as `colon_open_map` already did.

Nothing here is new BEHAVIOUR: item 19 edits no runtime file, and these pins
are the shapes whose accumulation changed, held fixed so a later runtime change
cannot move them silently.  What is still punted is the residue the join cannot
reach — whites before the indicator (the indent machinery) and a mid-line park
that crosses nothing.

/-! ## §1  Sibling sequence entries across a break

The park is mid-line in every one of these; the landing is column 0, and the
new entry snocs onto the accumulated `SBlockSeqEntries` there. -/

/-! ## §2  The empty-key mapping reached across a break

Item 13's `colon_open_map` was already anchored at the landing; only its gate
kept `: a⏎: b`'s second entry out. -/

/-! ## §3  Break-crossed `:` after content — scanned, then refused by the parser

The accumulation's bare-document over-approximation admits the SCAN (this is
what item 19 turns from `scannerDrop` into `[189]`'s empty-key entry); the
parser rejects the document that results.  Both pipelines, same place. -/

#guard verdicts "x\n: v\n" ==

#guard verdicts "x\n:\n" ==

#guard verdicts "&a x\n: v\n" ==
  (some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0), some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0))
-- Two breaks land just as one does; only the reported line moves.
#guard verdicts "x\n\n: v\n" ==
  (some (.invalidBareDocument 2 0), some (.invalidBareDocument 2 0))

/-! ## §4  Still punted — the residue the join cannot reach

Whites before the indicator are the indent machinery's arm (`hws` is `cons`,
not `nil`), and a nested level is `n ≠ 0`.  Both accept through the deferral,
unchanged. -/

  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP", "=VAL :a", "+SEQ", "=VAL :b", "=VAL :c", "-SEQ",
   "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]
-- Not an indented entry at all: `  - b` is absorbed by the plain scalar, which
-- is why the punted set is smaller than the indentation looks.
#guard emits "- a\n  - b\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ", "=VAL :a - b", "-SEQ", "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §5  The neighbours — must NOT move, identical in BOTH pipelines -/

#guard verdicts "a: b\n- c\n" ==
  (some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0), some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0))
-- No break, mid-line park: §3 of Reflection 643's residue — `- b` here is
-- plain content, not an entry.
