/-! # The col-0 plain implicit key composes (DOCS item 15)

`a: b` — a top-level plain scalar at column 0 whose same-line `:` resolves
the saved simple key — now accumulates as GRAMMAR instead of riding the
`scannerDrop` deferral: `[193] ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`'s YAML arm
(`ns-plain(0, block-key)` = the one-line reading), `[66]`'s optional
in-line separation, `GLit ':'`, and `pendingMapValue` awaiting the value
(item 13's mapping machinery, re-anchored at the key).

The coupling that fires the arm rides `PendingNode`'s scanner-state
parameter (item 12's design): the saved key is possible AND rests on the
current line — exactly the §7.4 pass `scanValueValidate` demands — iff the
parked plain scalar crossed no break, which is what lets a `.flowOut`
multi-line production re-read at `.blockKey`.  The witness chain is line
arithmetic: `saveSimpleKey` stamps `pos := currentPos` at the content
START, the scan only ever advances the line, and the fold arms advance it
STRICTLY (`collectPlainScalarLoop_line_le` + the one-line conjunct of
`collectPlainScalarLoop_prod`).

The pins below fix the composed shapes and the neighbours that stay put:
punted packs (quoted keys, indented keys) still accept through the
deferral, and the multiline shapes the coupling refutes still reject at
the same place in BOTH pipelines.

/-! ## §2  Punted packs — accepted through the deferral, recorded in row 12

This pass packs only PLAIN content at column 0; these accept unchanged and
stay with the campaign's remaining arms.  (`[188]`'s JSON arm — the quoted
keys — was packed by item 16; see `ScannerQuotedKeyCompose.lean`.) -/

/-! ## §3  The refuted neighbours — must NOT move, identical in BOTH pipelines

The multiline shapes the §7.4 coupling excludes keep their rejections. -/

-- A col-0 continuation line is ABSORBED by the plain scalar (`x a` gains),
-- so the `:` meets a stale cross-line key — the scan rejects (item 14's
-- refutation, unchanged).
#guard verdicts "x\na: b\n" == (some (.invalidImplicitKey 1), some (.invalidImplicitKey 1))
-- A value cannot itself become an implicit key on the same line.
#guard verdicts "a: b: c\n" == (some (.trailingContent 0 3), some (.trailingContent 0 3))
-- A completed quoted document refuses a following bare mapping — the
-- accumulation's over-approximation admits the SCAN, the parser rejects.
#guard verdicts "\"x\"\na: b\n" ==
  (some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0), some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0))
