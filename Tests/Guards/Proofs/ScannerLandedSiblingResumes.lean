/-! # A landed sibling after COMPLETED content resumes its level (DOCS item 109)

Item 108 split the sibling family in two and paid one half.  A landing that
meets a park still AWAITING a node reaches `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`'s dedent
branch, which pops the frames; a landing that meets COMPLETED content does not
reach that branch at all.  It goes through `accum_content_pending`'s shared
landing skeleton (`h_defer_split`), which closes the park with `close_with_ssl`
and hands `content_dispatch_after_close` a ROOT key context — so the landed key
opened a fresh `[187] l+block-mapping` under `[211]`'s `implicitContinue`,
which is a document the parser never starts.  That is row 19's third
over-approximation, and it is why `?⏎  a: b⏎  c: d⏎: - w` was not closed.

This item gives the skeleton the frames.  `pendingContent` gains the two faces
the value completion can already state — the stream-bottomed stack and the
`?`-frame-bottomed one — `resumectx_of_landing` reads the landing at the
ENTRIES level, and `content_dispatch_routed` prefers that reading where it
exists.  Then the landed key's entry is the resumed level's next element
(`resumeMapRoute`), the levels below it stand ready for the landing after that
(`resumeMapRouteF`), and the `?` entry is still open when its `: - w` line
arrives.

Nothing about the two new fields makes the old ones weaker: `h_closable` is the
stream face's `ResumeFrames.close` and `h_vpack` is the value face's, which §3
checks.

§1 pins the family at the runtime; §2–§5 are the payment at its types; §6 is the
discrimination — what the resume route does NOT need — and §7 is what the item
does not close. -/

/-! ## §2 The resumed route, at its type

`[195]`'s tail is `(s-indent(k) ns-l-block-map-entry(k))*`, so the landed key's
entry is that tail's FIRST element and everything below the level closes with
`ResumeFrames.close`.  No document is started. -/

example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    (h_frames : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_end) :
    ∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v → SLYamlStream sp_start sp_v :=
  resumeMapRoute h_ind h_frames

-- The ENTRIES-level twin is one lemma over item 108's parameterized bottom, so
-- the same construction serves the stream face …
example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    (h_frames : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_end) :
    ∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v →
    ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail k sp_v sp_e →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_e :=
  resumeMapRouteF h_ind h_frames

-- … and the `?` frame's value-line face, which is the one that keeps the
-- explicit entry open across the sibling.
example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k nv : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    (h_frames : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_end) :
    ∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v →
    ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail k sp_v sp_e →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_e :=
  resumeMapRouteF h_ind h_frames

/-! ## §3 The two new fields SUBSUME the two closes they ride beside

This is why `pendingContent`'s `h_closable` and `h_vpack` do not move: each is
its face's `ks`-closed reading.  A park that pays a frames face therefore owes
nothing new, and a park that punts loses nothing. -/

example {sp_start sp_scan : SurfPos} {ks : List Nat}
    (h : ∀ sp_mid : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_mid) :
    ∀ sp_mid, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid → SLYamlStream sp_start sp_mid :=
  fun sp_mid h_ssl => (h sp_mid h_ssl).close

example {sp_start sp_scan : SurfPos} {nv : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h : ∀ sp_mid : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_mid) :
    ∀ sp_mid sp_i sp_c : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid →
      SIndent nv sp_mid sp_i → GLit ':' sp_i sp_c →
      ∀ sp_v : SurfPos, SBlockIndented nv .blockOut sp_c sp_v →
      SLYamlStream sp_start sp_v :=
  fun sp_mid sp_i sp_c h_ssl h_ind h_lit sp_v h_sbi =>
    (h sp_mid h_ssl).close sp_i sp_c h_ind h_lit sp_v h_sbi

/-! ## §4 The park's payment: the SAME node both closures wrap

The producer hands the value node — completed on the landing's
`[79] s-l-comments` — to the pending's transport faces instead of to their
closes.  Nothing is re-derived, which is what makes the field free at the three
value-completion sites and `Or.inr trivial` everywhere else. -/

example {sp_start sp_scan : SurfPos} {n nv : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (build : ∀ sp_mid, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid → SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_mid)
    (closeFV : ∀ sp_mid, SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_mid →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_mid) :
    (∃ (nv : Nat) (ks : List Nat), ∀ sp_mid : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_mid) ∨ True :=
  Or.inl ⟨nv, ks, fun sp_mid h_ssl => closeFV sp_mid (build sp_mid h_ssl)⟩

/-! ## §5 The landing's context, read at the entries level

`resumectx_of_landing` takes the landing the caller already closed with — not a
fresh derivation of it — because the frames are stated over the park's own
`[79] s-l-comments` and a second witness could not be joined to the first. -/

example {sc s_prep : ScannerState} {c : Char}
    {sp_start sp_scan sp_mid sp_prep : SurfPos}
    (hcol_mid : sp_mid.col = 0)
    (h_ws : GStar SSWhite sp_mid sp_prep)
    (h_ssl : SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid)
    (h_preprocess : scanNextToken_preprocess sc = .ok (some (s_prep, c)))
    (h_fS : (∃ ks : List Nat, ∀ sp_m : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_m →
        ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_m) ∨ True)
    (h_fV : (∃ (nv : Nat) (ks : List Nat), ∀ sp_m : SurfPos, SSLComments sp_scan sp_m →
        ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) ks sp_m) ∨ True) :
    ResumeKeyCtx s_prep sp_start sp_prep :=
  resumectx_of_landing hcol_mid h_ws h_ssl h_preprocess h_fS h_fV

-- **The LEFT disjunct is inhabitable, from exactly the data a paying park has.**
-- A `∨ True` cannot be interrogated after the fact (proof irrelevance), so the
-- check that matters is that the informative side is reachable at all: the
-- landing's line start, `[63]`'s spaces, a fresh at-position save, and a stack
-- whose widths include the landing's.  `resumectx_of_landing` assembles this
-- and nothing else.
example {sp_start sp_land sp_prep : SurfPos} {k : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    {s_prep : ScannerState}
    (hcol0 : sp_land.col = 0) (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_prep)
    (h_fr : ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_land) (hmem : k ∈ ks)
    (h_poss : s_prep.simpleKey.possible = true)
    (h_pos : s_prep.simpleKey.pos = s_prep.currentPos) :
    ResumeKeyCtx s_prep sp_start sp_prep :=
  match h_fr.resumeAt hmem with
  | ⟨ks', h_lt, cont⟩ =>
      Or.inl ⟨⟨k, ks', sp_land, hcol0, h_ind, h_lt, cont, Or.inr trivial⟩, h_poss, h_pos⟩

/-! ## §6 The discrimination: what the resumed route does NOT need

`rootMapRoute` takes `SLYamlStream sp_start sp_land` — the stream CLOSED at the
landing — and that hypothesis is exactly what forces `[211]`'s
`implicitContinue`: having closed, the only way back in is a new document.  The
resumed route takes no such hypothesis.  The examples in §2 are already stated
without one; this one says it the other way round, by deriving `rootMapRoute`'s
own conclusion from frames alone in a context where no closed stream is
available at the landing at all. -/

example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    -- The ONLY thing known about `sp_land`: the levels open there.  No
    -- `sp_land.col = 0`, no `SLYamlStream sp_start sp_land`.
    (h_frames : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_end)
    {sp_v : SurfPos} (h_entry : SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v) :
    SLYamlStream sp_start sp_v :=
  resumeMapRoute h_ind h_frames sp_v h_entry

-- And the payoff, at its type: after the sibling the `?` entry is STILL owed
-- its value line — which is what `? a: b⏎  c: d⏎: e`'s `: e` supplies.
example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k nv : Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    (h_frames : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (ExplValueLine sp_start nv) [] sp_end)
    {sp_v : SurfPos} (h_entry : SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v)
    {sp_e : SurfPos} (h_tail : SCompactMapTail k sp_v sp_e) :
    ExplValueLine sp_start nv sp_e :=
  (resumeMapRouteF h_ind h_frames sp_v h_entry sp_e h_tail).close

/-! ## §7 What this item does NOT close

* `pendingBlockContent` — the entry-parked completed content — keeps the root
  context; its own producers' payments are not made here.  (CLOSED by item 110,
  which needed no new field: `h_closeF` was already sized at the entry level.
  ~~`- a: b⏎  c: d`~~ was the wrong input to name for it — that one parks
  `pendingContent`, the `b` being a completed mapping value; the entry-parked
  family is `k:⏎  - a⏎b: 2`.)
* The PROPS landing.  `content_dispatch_routed`'s `h_props_key` still reads
  only the root key context, so a landed `&p c: d` sibling re-opens at the root
  as before; `PropsKeyPack` carries no resume twin to spend.  (CLOSED by item
  111: the pack gains items 99/108's twins and `h_props_key` resumes first.)
* The block-scalar value arms of the two `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue`
  lemmas punt their frames (`? a: |⏎  x⏎  c: d`): the node there is complete at
  the park rather than at the landing, so the transport face does not apply
  unchanged.
* The construction sites themselves.  `SLYamlStream.implicitContinue` still
  takes `GOpt SLAnyDocument` where `[211]` writes `l-explicit-document?` after a
  prefix-only continuation; tightening the CONSTRUCTOR is row 19's own step, and
  what this item removes is the reason the landing skeleton needed it. -/
