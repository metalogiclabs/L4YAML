# The park's literal has no carrier — what a `GLit` costs where the six stand

Item 244 measured the width of `PendingNode.pendingFlow`'s gap and found it
**one scanner step at six of the producer's twelve application sites**, two at a
seventh, and proved the step is exactly one `ScannerState.advance` — so the
production the six owe is a single `GLit` for `-`, `?` or `:`.  It left the
number nothing held: **what that literal costs where the six stand.**

This module answers it with four readings and three proofs.

**§1 asks what the six sites' grammar path ENDS in**, which is the question item
244's census never posed: it measured that a path exists and how many steps sit
beyond it, not what the last production on it is.  At all six the answer is the
same and it is one edge long: `GStar SSWhite` — `[33] s-white` repeated — and
`SIndent`, both running from the park's own position `sp_X` to the position the
dispatch's input correspondence stands at.  Whitespace.  Nothing on the path
opens a collection, and nothing on it is a literal.

**§2 reads what the stream can be extended BY.**  `SLYamlStream`'s three honest
constructors each reach their right endpoint through `GStar SLDocumentSuffix`,
so the alphabet that can move a stream's end is three productions wide —
`SLDocumentPrefix`, `SLAnyDocument`, `SLDocumentSuffix`.  Only one of the three
can contain a `GLit` at all, and it is **four productions above it**:
`SLAnyDocument > SLBareDocument > SBlockNode > SBlockSeqEntries > GLit`.  The
other two encode their own literals as constructor patterns
(`SCDocumentEnd.mk` matches `'.' :: '.' :: '.' :: rest` directly), so "cannot
reach `GLit`" is a statement about the combinator, not about the characters.

**§3 is the price.**  A production can end at a literal — thirty of the
library's two hundred and thirty-five constructors do.  Twenty-three of those
thirty end at one of the three block indicators, and every one of the
twenty-three is a FLOW form: `MapFrame`, `SeqFrame`, `PendingFlowMapEntry`,
`PendingFlowSeqEntry`, `SFlowMapEntry`, `SFlowSeqEntry`.  **`-` ends nothing at
all**, and none of the three productions on the six sites' own chain —
`SBlockSeqEntries`, `SBlockMapEntry`, `SBlockIndented` — is among the thirty.

**§4 closes the loop the mandate warned about.**  The twenty-three that exist
ride the flow stack, and `block_dispatch_deferred` hands its park
`FlowStackB sp_start 0 0 none 0 #[] #[] .sep sp_X sp_X` beside
`BlockStack.nil sp_X`.  Both carriers are reflexive — `BlockStack` has one
constructor and it concludes `BlockStack sp sp`, and a depth-zero `FlowStackB`
is `nil` by the library's own `pos_eq_of_depth_zero` — so neither can hold a
character.  `park_carriers_absorb_nothing` is that, proved.

The ratio names the missing piece exactly: `SeqFrame` and `MapFrame` carry TEN
constructors each; `BlockStack` carries ONE, and it is the same arm
`SeqFrame.betweenEmpty` is — the only one of the ten that is reflexive by
construction.  The block side has the empty frame and none of the nine that
follow it.

**The cheap experiment the mandate named SUCCEEDS, and its statement is the
bill.**  `seq_entry_of_park_span` spends item 244's literal at the shape the six
stand in: the path's `SIndent` and the dispatch's `GLit '-'` are premises one
and two of `SBlockSeqEntries.single`.  What it buys is
`SBlockSeqEntries n sp_mid sp_end` — and `sp_end` is where the entry's CONTENT
ends, not where the character does.  The two unpaid premises are named in the
lemma's own binders: `GNot SNsChar` and `SBlockIndented n .blockIn`.

So the literal costs a carrier, and the park has set both of its carriers to
empty.  The measurement is `ParkGapProduction` below; every number it prints is
re-derived from the environment at elaboration time.

/-! ## §1 The park's two carriers absorb nothing -/

/-- `BlockStack` has a single constructor and it is reflexive, so the relation
    cannot separate its two positions.  The library cannot STATE an open block
    collection; `BlockStack` is a placeholder for one. -/
lemma blockStack_refl {a b : SurfPos} (h : BlockStack a b) : a = b := by
  cases h; rfl

/-- **Neither carrier the park hands its consumer can hold a character.**  The
    two hypotheses are `block_dispatch_deferred`'s own second and third
    conjuncts; the conclusion says the grammar position it parks at and the
    position its flow stack reaches are the same point.  A `GLit` spent here has
    nowhere to land: the flow forms that END at a block indicator (§3) all need
    a frame, and this stack is at depth zero. -/

  rw [blockStack_refl hb, FlowStackB.pos_eq_of_depth_zero hf]

/-- **The cheap experiment, spent.**  The census's path (`SIndent`) and item
    244's span (`GLit '-'`) are premises one and two of
    `SBlockSeqEntries.single`.  The literal composes — and what it composes INTO
    ends at `sp_end`, the end of the entry's content, not at `sp_scan'`, where
    the scanner's cursor stands.  `h_nns` and `h_content` are the price, and
    `h_content` is a whole block node the park has not scanned. -/
