# The span instrument, measured (DOCS item 229)

Item 228 priced the suffix lemma for `Surface/Node.lean`'s mutual block by
SIGNATURES, before a line of it existed: **69 constructor arms**.  This file
re-derives that number and the one the price missed.

§1 walks the closure of production types reachable from the block and counts
what a suffix family actually has to cover.  §2 counts how much of the closure
the library now relates to `List.IsSuffix`.  §3 pins the eighteen mutual-block
lemmas by name.  §4 sorts the four residues of `Proofs.FlowKeyLift` by the
only question a narrowing's worth turns on — can a consumer refute it.

The discipline these pins carry: **a price taken by signatures prices the
thing it counted, not the thing that has to be built**.  69 is right about the
block and is 48% of the arms the instrument needed.

/-! ## §0 The instrument is not vacuous

A suffix lemma over an uninhabited family is true and worth nothing, and this
tree has had constructors that nothing ever instantiated (DOCS items 33, 107).
So the family is exercised on a derivation first: `[]`, the empty flow
sequence, read as `[161] ns-flow-node(0, flow-out)`, and the instrument
applied to it. -/

/-- A real derivation in the mutual block. -/
example (rest : List Char) (col : Nat) :
    SFlowNode 0 .flowOut ⟨'[' :: ']' :: rest, col⟩ ⟨rest, col + 2⟩ :=
  SFlowNode.content 0 .flowOut _ _
    (SFlowContent.flowSeq 0 .flowOut _ _
      (SFlowSequence.empty 0 .flowOut _ _ _ _
        (GLit.mk _ _) (GOpt.none _) (GLit.mk _ _)))

/-- …and `sFlowNode_suffix` on it: the two brackets are the span. -/
example (rest : List Char) (col : Nat) : rest <:+ '[' :: ']' :: rest :=
  sFlowNode_suffix (SFlowNode.content 0 .flowOut _ _
    (SFlowContent.flowSeq 0 .flowOut _ _
      (SFlowSequence.empty 0 .flowOut ⟨'[' :: ']' :: rest, col⟩ _ _ ⟨rest, col + 2⟩
        (GLit.mk _ _) (GOpt.none _) (GLit.mk _ _))))

/-! ## §1 The closure the instrument had to cover

A "production" is any constant whose type ends `… → SurfPos → SurfPos → Prop`.
The walk starts at the mutual block and follows constructor types AND def
bodies — the first version of this census followed only inductives and read
**48** types, because `[69] s-separate(n,c)`, `[131] ns-plain(n,c)` and eleven
others are `def`s that dispatch on the context.  A closure walk that stops at
a definition under-reports the thing it is pricing. -/

/-! ## §2 How much of it the library relates to a suffix

The same reading item 228's `ConclusionObligationCensus` §4 takes, widened
from the 18 to the whole closure: a type is covered when some theorem's TYPE
mentions both it and `List.IsSuffix`.  At item 228 this read 10 of 74 — the
comment family in `Proofs/Coupling/TabIndentBridge.lean`. -/

/-- 69 of the 74; the five that never appear in a suffix lemma's TYPE are
    `abbrev`s — `SBAsLineFeed` and `SBNonContent` are `[28] b-break`, and
    `SNbChar`, `SNsChar`, `SCommentChar` are `GChar` at three predicates — so
    `sbBreak_suffix` and `gchar_suffix` cover them definitionally and a second
    statement would be a second name for the same fact. -/

answers differ. -/

/-! ## §5 Where the 83 dead sites actually go

Item 228's FALSE probe read **83** compiler errors for `flowNode_toKey` and
its NEXT called the suffix lemma "the one thing that would turn 83 dead sites
into 83 payable ones".  The lemma exists now, and that sentence is wrong: a
site is payable when the leaf it declines through carries a REFUTABLE residue,
and at item 229 the four leaves were not alike.

(The two numbers below are 82, not 83.  They are a different instrument —
occurrences of `@Or.inr _ True _` in the proof term, against a count of errors
after rewriting the conclusion — and neither corrects the other; item 228's
own instrument debt records that an error count is a property of how a proof
is written.)

This counts the leaf applications in `flowNode_toKey`'s own proof TERM — not
its source text, so the number survives a re-indent — and splits them by
whether the leaf's residue can be discharged.

**Re-aimed at item 231, because re-pinning it would have emptied it.**  The
sweep selected `@Or.inr _ True _`, and item 231 rebuilt the eighteen motives
so that `flowNode_toKey` carries none: the four numbers would have read
`noop=0 payable=0 blocked=0 relay=0` and the gate would have passed over an
empty population.  It now selects on the right disjunct's type either way and
reports both, so `noop=0` is an assertion and `carried` is the population the
other three are taken over.

**Re-aimed again at item 232, and for the opposite reason**: the population
did not empty, it OCTUPLED.  The conversion is now a `mutual` block of eight
structurally recursive lemmas rather than one recursor application, and
mutual structural recursion does not share a fixpoint — each lemma is its own
`T.brecOn` over the same 41 arms, so each of the eight carries all 82
declining sites.  Reading `flowNode_toKey` alone would still have said
`carried=82` and said nothing about the other seven.  The sweep walks all
eight and ASSERTS their splits are equal; `exports` is what makes the
replication visible, and the four numbers after it are per export, unmoved
since item 230.

**The classification is looked up in the environment, not written here.**  A
leaf counts as payable exactly when the library carries a lemma that returns
the conversion from a consumer's hypotheses.  Item 229's split named the
`sep_*` lane `blocked` in a `let`, and item 230 made that lane payable without
moving a single one of these counts — the census would have kept passing while
its own words went stale.  Selecting on the payment lemma is what stops that:
the roster below is a list of pairs, and a pair pays only if its second name
resolves. -/

/-! ## §6 What the operation cost, in constructor arms (DOCS item 230)

Item 229's NEXT priced the `sep_toKey` re-proof by signatures at **12
constructor arms**, naming seven productions: `[79] s-l-comments` 2,
`[76] s-b-comment` 2, `[78] l-comment` 1, `[77] b-comment` 2,
`[71] s-flow-line-prefix` 1, `[63] s-indent(n)` 2, `[66] s-separate-in-line`
2.  All seven were needed and all twelve arms were cased on.  They were not
all of it.

This walks the proof TERMS of the item's declarations — through their matcher
auxiliaries, which is where a `match` puts its case analysis — collects every
eliminator applied to an inductive, and sums that inductive's constructor
count.  It is the same shape as §1's closure walk and it fails the same way if
you stop at the named productions: the signature walk enumerated the YAML
productions and skipped the generic combinators the productions are built
from, which live in the same namespace and carry arms of their own. -/

/-! ## §7 What a recursor application exports (DOCS items 231, 232)

A recursor application hands back ONE of its motives.  At item 231
`flowNode_toKey` was one application of `SFlowNode.rec` carrying eighteen, and
its conclusion was `motive_11` applied to the major premise; the other
seventeen were reachable only by building a major premise of the head type and
INVERTING the result, which is what `flowContent_toBlockKey` did — it wrapped
an `SFlowContent` in `SFlowNode.content`, converted, and peeled.  The peel has
four arms and the conversion rules out none of them, so it could not return
the residue, and it was the one conclusion in `FlowKeyLift` ending in `True`.

That is items 229 and 230's corollary one level up: **a population enumerated
by a walk stops where the walk stops.**  There the walk was a signature list
and a name list; there it was the recursor's own major premise.

**Item 232 pays it.**  The conversion is a `mutual` block of eight
structurally recursive lemmas — accepted on a strict SUBFAMILY of the
eighteen, through each type's own `brecOn` with the ten unused `below` motives
filled by the elaborator, which is what item 231 did by hand with ten `True`s.
All eight types are exported and `flowContent_toBlockKey` reads its own lemma
instead of inverting, so `trueOnly` and `none` are both zero and this file has
no conclusion left ending in `True`.  What it cost is §5's `exports=8`: eight
fixpoints, not one shared one. -/

/-! ## §8 Who takes it (DOCS item 233)

Items 228–232 built the supply.  Four residues were named, eight conversions
were exported, six leaf payments were written.  This section asks the one
question none of those items asked of its own output — **who takes it** — and
answers it in the environment rather than by grep, because a consumer that
reaches a lemma through a bound variable or an abbreviation is invisible to a
textual search and a name that only appears in a docstring is visible to one.

**The eight exports have no user.**  The demand surface is the three
`*_toBlockKey` wrappers and the two declarations that apply them, both in
`StreamAccum`: `flowKeyHead` reads `flowNode_toBlockKey`, and
`accum_flow_open_depth0` reads `flowContent_toBlockKey` and `sep_toBlockKey`.
Both discard the residue — one with `fun _ => trivial`, one with a wildcard
pattern — and neither holds a fact that would refute it, which is what
`elsewhere=0` below says once it is read as a statement about the whole
library rather than about those two.

**The six leaf payments have no user either.**  Items 229 and 230 built
`plain_toKey_of_noBreak`, `doubleQuoted_toKey_of_noBreak`,
`singleQuoted_toKey_of_noBreak`, `sep_toKey_of_noResidue`,
`sepOpt_toKey_of_noResidue` and `props_toKey_of_noResidue`, and nothing has
instantiated one.  That is this repository's own rule — *a definition nothing
has instantiated is not yet evidence* — read against our own work, and the
census is here so the next item reads it as a number instead of finding it
again.

**Item 223 is the precedent and its title is the lesson**: *tightening the
supply changes nothing until the demand is re-asked.*  It built the ledger for
the pending-park family (`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ArmDemandLedger.lean`) and asks
of a PARAMETER whether its consumers request the strong form.  This asks the
same question of a CONCLUSION, where the weaker answer is available: whether a
consumer exists at all.

**The payment is one `resolve_right`, not forty-eight.**  §5 reports
`payable=48` leaf applications per export, and 48 is a count of PRODUCERS: the
residue widens (`sepResidue_widen`), so every interior one is a residue of the
whole span and a consumer holding the two facts discharges all of them at
once.  The three payments measure it: each contains exactly one
`Or.resolve_right`, and their proof terms are two orders of magnitude smaller
than the export they pay for.

**And the reason there is no consumer is a missing coordinate, not a careless
one.**  `BreakBetween` does not occur in the type of a single declaration
outside the two modules that define the residue vocabulary, so there is
nothing for a consumer to hold: six declarations ASK for `¬ BreakBetween`,
two PROVE one, and both of those two prove it of a literal character list.
**Nothing in the library refutes a break over a derivation**, which is
`overDerivation=0` below and is the supply side in one number.  What `[193] c-s-implicit-json-key` supplies
is a fact about the SCANNER's line counter; `ScannerSurfCorr` — the
correspondence between a scanner state and a surface position — has five
fields and none of them is the line, and `SurfPos` has two, `chars` and `col`.
The price of the supply side is that coordinate.  `scripts/flip_supply.py`
prices the other half: tightening the head promise to take the two facts
breaks four definitions from seven locations, and that is a lower bound
because the build stops at the module all four live in. -/
