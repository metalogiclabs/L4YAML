/-! # The census over CONCLUSION ROUTES (DOCS item 213)

Item 212 built the census the four term censuses had each called missing, for
the SUPPLY direction: for every application of a constant with a `_ ∨ True`
binder, what decides that argument.  It closed with the other half still open:

> The relay census answers the UPWARD direction — who supplies an optional
> premise — and it is now a gate.  **The DOWNWARD direction, a conclusion
> conjunct traced into the lemmas that produce it, is still followed by hand,
> one narrowing and one build at a time.**

This is that instrument.  For every `_ ∨ True` in the CONCLUSION of a
`StreamAccum` lemma, follow the proof term to the position that produces it and
resolve what decides it there.

## What a route is

A conclusion's optional conjuncts sit at addresses: left or right of an `∧`,
inside an `∃`, or inside the payload of another `_ ∨ True`.  The census walks
the type to collect those addresses and then walks the PROOF to the same
address, entering `And.intro`, `Exists.intro` and `Or.inl` as it goes.  On the
way it follows the same three things item 212's walk follows — a `have` through
its beta-redex, a `let`, and a case split into each of its alternatives — plus
two more the downward direction needs:

* **`split`'s SPLITTER.**  `split` leaves a `<matcher>.splitter` behind, and the
  splitter is PRIVATE to the module that ran it while its matcher is not, so the
  private prefix has to come off before the matcher table will answer.  Its
  alternatives carry extra hypotheses the matcher's do not, so their binder
  counts are read off the splitter's OWN telescope.
* **PIPES.**  `Or.imp`, `Eq.mpr`, `Eq.ndrec`, `cast`, `id`, `dite` — the
  combinators a tactic leaves behind.  None of them decides an `∨`; each carries
  someone else's.  Reading a pipe as a producer is what makes a relay invisible,
  and it is the same error in the downward direction as the one item 212
  measured in the upward one.

## What each answer means

`PAY` / `DECLINE` — an `Or.inl` / `Or.inr` written for this conjunct on this
arm.  `VIA g` — the conjunct is `g`'s conclusion, so `g` decides it.  `RELAY` —
it is one of the lemma's own premises, so its CALLERS decide it.  `FIELD …` — it
was unpacked from a structure or a destructuring.  `VACUOUS` — the arm is closed
by `False.elim`, so it decides nothing.  `PARENT-DECLINED` — the conjunct lives
inside another optional conjunct's payload and that arm declined the parent, so
this one was never reached.  `UNREACHABLE` — no route exists; see the blind spot
below.

## The control that could fail, and did not

Item 212 measured four rows of `ConclusionCensus` by NARROWING AND BUILDING,
with no term walk involved.  This census re-derives all four from the proof
terms alone:

| lemma | item 212, by build | read here |
|---|---|---|
| `scanValue_ok_park_facts` | declines on one branch of a `split`, pays on the other | `DECLINE ∣ PAY ∣ VACUOUS ×3` |
| `back_col` | relays a structure FIELD of `KmSound` | `FIELD of premise#3` — and premise 3 is the `KmSound` |
| `close_col_of_base` | relays `back_col` | `FIELD of VIA KmSound.back_col` |
| `flowKeyHead` | relays into `flowNode_toBlockKey`, in **another module** | `VIA FlowKeyLift.flowNode_toBlockKey` |

A fifth agreement nobody asked for: item 212's fixpoint found **three**
decisions inside `keyctx_of_preprocess`, at StreamAccum `L26245`, `L26256` and
`L26278`.  This census reads that lemma's conjunct as `DECLINE ∣ DECLINE ∣
DECLINE ∣ PAY ∣ PAY`.

## What it found: two rows that read the same and mean the opposite

Compared conjunct by conjunct against `ConclusionCensus` under that census's own
grammar key — route PAY-arms against its `inl`, route DECLINE-arms against its
`inr` — **20 of 22 agree and 2 disagree**, and both disagreements are real:

* `scanValue_ok_park_facts#0` — route `1+1`, term `0+0`.  Item 212's row,
  re-derived.
* `explFrameValueLine#0` — route `0+0`, term `1+1`.  **New.**  The proof is
  `frameChainUnion (match h_expl with …) h_kslot`: the `Or.inl` and the
  `Or.inr trivial` the key counted are written for `frameChainUnion`'s optional
  PREMISE, and the lemma decides its own conclusion nowhere.

`flowVPack_of_close` reads `inl=1,inr=1 ∣ un=0,0` in `ConclusionCensus` and so
does `explFrameValueLine` — **the same row** — and one of them decides its
conjunct while the other decides nothing.  The `un` column cannot separate them:
it catches a payment made for a PREMISE only when the premise's skeleton differs
from every conclusion conjunct, and a relay's premise is the same proposition as
its conclusion by construction.

Checked against the compiler, predictions written before the patch (DOCS 213):

* narrowing `explFrameValueLine`'s conclusion to `∨ False` breaks it at
  **L6588**, the `frameChainUnion` application — NOT at its `Or.inl` (L6591) or
  its `Or.inr trivial` (L6597);
* narrowing `flowVPack_of_close`'s breaks it at **L962**, its own
  `Or.inr trivial`, and not at its `Or.inl` on L961, because `Or.inl x` still
  elaborates at `A ∨ False` — item 211's lesson, which is why `∨ False` is the
  falsifier and `P` alone is a control that cannot fail.

## What the same build says about counting errors

`explFrameValueLine` has **four** supply edges in item 212's census and the
narrowing refused **three** terms.  The fourth, `pendingProps#21` at L30289,
shares one application with the refused `entryPropsKeyPack_of_dispatch#10` at
L30241, and

```lean
def sink (_a : (0 = 0) ∨ True) (_b : (0 = 0) ∨ True) : Nat := 0
def BAD : (0 = 0) ∨ False := Or.inl rfl
example : Nat := sink BAD BAD      -- ONE error, not two
```

says why: within one application the first refused argument masks its siblings.
**A narrowing's error count is a LOWER bound on the number of supplies.**  At
item 212 the two agreed exactly — eight errors against an eight-entry seed — so
the gap is not visible until an application carries two of them.

## The blind spot, named rather than counted

Two of the 24 conjuncts have no route: `flowKeyRoute_of_open#1` and
`flowKeyRoute_of_root#1` sit under a `→` inside a paid payload, so reaching them
means entering a function the proof has not applied.  They are pinned by name
below, not swept into a number.

## The hole this leaves in item 212's own producer surface

`RelaySupplyCensus` pins thirteen constants as the module's producer surface.
Under the pipe test above, `Or.imp` (39 edges) and `dite` (4) are not producers
at all — they carry a decision made elsewhere — which is **43 of the 79 `VIA`
edges**, more than half.  The split is re-derived from item 212's own pinned
list below rather than asserted here; what it costs to follow those 43 to their
sources is the supply census's next item, not this one's. -/

/-- **Item 212's producer surface, split by the pipe test**, re-derived from that
    census's OWN pinned lists rather than counted again here.  ~~Of its 79 `VIA`
    edges, 43 name a combinator that decides nothing.~~  **Item 214 followed the
    43**, so the supply census reports no pipe rows at all and this half of the
    pin would now pass vacuously; it is restated against what replaced them.

    The two censuses reconcile on item 212's published figure: the surviving
    producer surface (`producers`) plus everything the pipes landed on
    (`landed`) is `total=79`, which is the `VIA` count item 212 pinned before
    either direction could follow a pipe.  `landed-producers=0` is the finding:
    **not one of the 43 reaches a producer.**  The landing table's own parts are
    summed here too, so a row added to it without its total moving fails.  If
    item 212's lists move, its gate fails before this one does. -/
