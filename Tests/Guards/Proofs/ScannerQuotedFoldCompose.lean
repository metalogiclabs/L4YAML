/-! # The multi-line quoted value reads at the entry's index (DOCS item 53)

Since item 45 a multi-line quoted token was a `*Crossed` witness — the
reading renounced at any nonzero index — and the indented arms deferred it.
Item 53 pays the reading: the scanner's own fold guards (the §6.1 tab gate,
the §9.1.2 marker check, the §8.1 under-indent check) refuse every landing
`s-flow-line-prefix(n)` cannot read, so the same loop inductions that build
the 0-readings build the reading at any `n ≤ currentIndent + 1`
(`collectDoubleQuotedLoop_prod_at` / `collectSingleQuotedLoop_prod_at`),
and both indented content arms consume it through the analysis lemma's new
fold disjunct.

The runtime's share: the ESCAPED-break landing (`"x\⏎y"`) had no checks at
all — `[112] s-double-escaped(n)` ends in the same `s-flow-line-prefix(n)`,
so item 53 gives the escaped landing the fold's three checks (on a CONTENT
landing; a blank landing is `l-empty` and is checked by the fold next
iteration).  §1 pins the compositions; §2 the escaped-landing flips and the
preserved boundaries. -/
