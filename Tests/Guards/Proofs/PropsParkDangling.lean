/-! # The property lane's reading, and the half of it that scans clean (DOCS item 158)

Item 156 derived §9.2's dangling reading at the producer for a content dispatch
off `&`/`!`; item 157 built the consumer face for `pendingContent` and left the
property lane as the gate's named residue, recording that "the lane IS
refutable and the scanner already refuses every shape in it".

This item lands the producer half for the property arm and measures the second
claim, which is **half true**:

* `dispatchContent_tokens_push_prop` — a `&` pushes one `.anchor` and a `!` one
  `.tag`, at the dispatch's own `currentPos`;
* `dispatchContent_tokens_push_node` — with the body arm beside it, the
  dispatcher's whole token census is ONE statement: exactly one node token, at
  its own position;
* `trailingNodeRun?_push_prop` / `_push_node` — a property pushed on top starts
  a trailing run of one, exactly as a body does;
* so `danglingPark_of_dispatch` and its two spent forms lose their `c ≠ '&'`
  and `c ≠ '!'` premises, and `ContentRouteGate`'s left disjunct loses them
  with it.

What the measurement adds is the lane's SPLIT.  A property run with a BLOCK
body is refused by the scanner at the run's start, which is the property (§2).
A property run whose body is a FLOW collection is not refused at all (§3): the
collection's close ends the trailing run, so §9.2's end-of-input check reads
`none`, and §8.1's floor measures the BRACKET's column, which the run has moved
right.  `a: 1⏎&p [b]` scans clean and the parser refuses it — so the props park
really does owe an unconditional route, and the face item 157 named cannot
simply be added.

§4 measures what the field would cost and where it stops. -/

/-! ## §1  The dispatcher's token census, in one statement

Off `&`/`!` the content dispatch pushes a node BODY (item 156); at `&`/`!` it
pushes a `[96] c-ns-properties` half.  There is no third arm, so the census is
one statement — and it is what takes the character premises off everything
below. -/

example {s s' : ScannerState} {c : Char}
    (hok : scanNextToken_dispatchContent s c = .ok s') :
    ∃ t : YamlToken, (t.isNodeBody = true ∨ t.isNodeProperty = true) ∧
      s'.tokens = s.tokens.push { pos := s.currentPos, val := t } :=
  dispatchContent_tokens_push_node hok

example {s s' : ScannerState}
    (hok : scanNextToken_dispatchContent s '&' = .ok s') :
    ∃ t : YamlToken, t.isNodeProperty = true ∧
      s'.tokens = s.tokens.push { pos := s.currentPos, val := t } :=
  dispatchContent_tokens_push_prop hok (Or.inl rfl)

example {s s' : ScannerState}
    (hok : scanNextToken_dispatchContent s '!' = .ok s') :
    ∃ t : YamlToken, t.isNodeProperty = true ∧
      s'.tokens = s.tokens.push { pos := s.currentPos, val := t } :=
  dispatchContent_tokens_push_prop hok (Or.inr rfl)

-- …and the run it starts is a run of ONE, with the array's own last real slot
-- as its predecessor — the property arm of `trailingNodeRun?`, which item 157
-- named as the missing piece.
example {ts : Array (Positioned YamlToken)} {p : Positioned YamlToken} {i : Nat}
    (hb : p.val.isNodeProperty = true)
    (hprev : prevRealIdx? ts ts.size = some i)
    (hprop : ts[i]!.val.isNodeProperty = false) :
    trailingNodeRun? (ts.push p) = some (ts.size, some i) :=
  trailingNodeRun?_push_prop hb hprev hprop

/-! ## §2  The refutation, with no case on the character

`danglingPark_of_dispatch` now reads the same at every content character, so
§9.2's two checks refuse a property park exactly as they refuse a scalar
one. -/

    (hok : scanNextToken_dispatchContent s '&' = .ok s')

/-! ## §3  The half that scanned clean — CLOSED by item 159

**This section recorded a hole, and half of its diagnosis was wrong.**  What it
said was that a property run whose body is a FLOW collection is not refused at
all, because §9.2's end-of-input check reads `trailingNodeRun?` and a `]` is
neither a body nor a property, while §8.1's floor measures the BRACKET's column
that the run has moved right.  Both halves of that are true.  What does NOT
follow is the remedy it implied: item 158's own "what remains" offered *closing
the hole at the flow open*, and an open cannot be the trigger, because a flow
collection can head an implicit KEY — `a: 1⏎&p [b]: c` PARSES, and so does
`k:⏎␣␣m:⏎␣␣␣␣- a⏎␣␣&p [1]: b`, which `FlowFrameResumeRider` already witnessed.

Item 159 closed it at the READING instead.  `[161] ns-flow-node` offers
`ns-flow-content`, and a flow collection is that as readily as a scalar is — so
`trailingNodeRun?` reads a trailing close back to its matching open
(`flowOpenIdx?`) and keeps walking the `[96]` run from there.  The terminator is
unchanged: the break, or end of input.  §4's flow consumer is what that buys.

The witnesses below are `SCAN-ERR` now, at the position they were already
`PARSE-ERR` at — the bare-open fifth included, which item 172's deferred floor
hands to the same dangling reading as its props-headed rows. -/

/-! ## §4  What the field would cost, and where it stops

`pendingProps.h_route` is the run's stream closure, and it is spent in three
places.  Two of them could pay a `danglingNodePos? sc = none` premise and the
third cannot:

| consumer | what it has |
|---|---|
| `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` | `h_nd`, item 157's own parameter — free |
| `accum_content_pending` (the run's extension and its ride into content) | the NEXT park's premise, one push later — relayed since item 165 |
| `accum_flow_open_depth0` (the ride into a flow collection) | ~~nothing: §3's park is live there~~ — item 159 took that input out of the domain |

~~The flow consumer is §3's own input read from the accumulation's side.  It can
be paid only by giving that arm the opaque resume instead of the props route,
which is a different item's decision, not a lemma.~~  **Item 159 closed §3
instead**: a dangling run that rides into a flow collection is refused at the
next break or at end of input, because the run is visible through the close now.
The input that arm could not pay for no longer reaches it.

The second consumer had its own obstacle, and it was a fact about the token
array rather than about the grammar.  A property run's reading transports across
a BODY push — the walk-back reaches the same run start — but it did not transport
across a PROPERTY push, because the start moved.

**Item 165 removed the input rather than the lemma — and item 170 put half of
it back.**  `[96]` derives one optional anchor and one optional tag, so a run
is at most TWO properties long, and both §6.9 guards decide by KIND on the
current LINE — which is blind to a run that crosses a break.  Item 165's
`propertyRunFull` decided by LENGTH alone and over-refused: a parent node's
full run beside its mapping's first key's fresh run reads the same way (9KAX,
found at item 169's matrix re-run).  Item 170 narrows the block reading to the
cursor's line, so `&a⏎!t &b x` is the PARSER's again and the start DOES move
at a scanner-reachable park — step 3 below reads `1,0` where step 2 read
`0,0`.  The premise relays through the BODY and OPEN pushes as before; ~~the
PROPERTY push returns the moved window (`PropsWindowCross`) and
`pendingProps.h_routeX` serves it without the verdict~~ — **item 181: the
PROPERTY push REFUTES**, because the pushed token is the third of an adjacent
property block and §9.2's fourth clause reads the duplicate kind, so the
relay's own premise is false there and the window is deleted
(`PropsCrossWindowRoute`). -/

-- Item 180: the crossed-block clause refuses the family at the SCANNER now
-- (EOF), at the position the parser reported.
#guard scanOk "&a\n!t &b x\n"
  == "SCAN-ERR L4YAML.ScanError.invalidBareDocument 1 3"
#guard parseOk "&a\n!t &b x\n"
  == "PARSE-ERR L4YAML.ScanError.invalidBareDocument 1 3"

-- `&a⏎!t &b x`: at step 2 the token run starts at the `&a` on line 0, because
-- `trailingNodeRun?` walks back over properties and has no line filter.  The
-- third property MOVES the start to the `!t` on line 1 — the crossed window —
-- and (item 180) the over-full block reads as the EXCESS property's position,
-- so the park is SOME from the `&b` on.
#guard (List.range 5).map (fun n => parkAt "&a\n!t &b x\n" n)
  == ["run=none park=none",
      "run=prop@0,0 pred=no-slot park=none",
      "run=prop@0,0 pred=no-slot park=none",
      "run=prop@1,0 pred=no-slot park=1,3",
      "run=prop@1,0 pred=no-slot park=1,3"]

-- The TWO-property run it stops at is untouched, across a break as on a line.
#guard (List.range 5).map (fun n => parkAt "&a\n!t x\n" n)
  == ["run=none park=none",
      "run=prop@0,0 pred=no-slot park=none",
      "run=prop@0,0 pred=no-slot park=none",
      "run=prop@0,0 pred=no-slot park=none",
      "no-state"]

-- The same three properties on ONE line stay scanner-refused — §6.9's kind
-- guard reads the line's own run, and item 170's narrowed length gate agrees.
#guard scanOk "&a !t &b x\n" == "SCAN-ERR L4YAML.ScanError.invalidNodeProperties '&' 0 6"

/-! ## §5  What the next item needs

The gate's right disjunct is unchanged in size and sharper in name: what is
missing at `&`/`!` is the park's own FIELD, not a refutation.  Landing it needs
three things this item has measured rather than assumed:

1. a premise shape that relays through a property push — `danglingNodePos? sc =
   none` does not, by §4's witness;
2. `pendingBlockContent.h_closable` guarded as `pendingContent.h_closable`
   already is, since the run's ride into an ENTRY parks there — its only
   consumer is `close_with_ssl`, which carries `h_nd` already;
3. ~~a decision about the flow ride: the opaque resume (`scannerDrop`, which
   `pendingFlow` already takes) in place of the props route whenever the park
   is dangling — or §3's hole closed in the scanner, which would make the two
   refusals agree at the position they already agree on.~~  **DONE (item 159)**,
   by the second route — and not at the flow OPEN, which §3 records is not a
   terminator at all.  See `Tests/Guards/Proofs/FlowRunDanglingClosed.lean`. -/
