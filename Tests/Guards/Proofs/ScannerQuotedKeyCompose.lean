/-! # The col-0 QUOTED implicit key composes (DOCS item 16)

`"a": b` and `'a': b` join item 15's `a: b` as GRAMMAR: `[188]
ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`'s **JSON** arm — `[194] c-s-implicit-json-key`
over `[161] ns-flow-node(0, block-key)`'s content alternative, i.e. `[109]
c-double-quoted(0, block-key)` or `[120] c-single-quoted(0, block-key)` —
then `[66]`'s optional in-line separation, `GLit ':'`, and item 13's
`pendingMapValue` awaiting the value.

Item 15's coupling field is unchanged; only its payload widened, from the
plain one-line reading to an `ImplicitKeyHead` carrying either arm of
`[188]`.  What the quoted heads needed was their own one-line reading, and
that one is SELF-CONTAINED rather than a conjunct: `[110]
nb-double-text(n, block-key)` IS `[111] nb-double-one-line`, so a walk
exiting on its entry line simply refutes the two arms that consume a break
— the escaped break (`\` + `b-char`) and the flow fold — both of which open
with `consumeNewline` (+1) and are followed by a walk that never returns.
The escape body is line-transparent for the same reason `s-white` is:
`ns-hex-digit` and the simple escape characters are not `b-char`.

The pins below fix the composed shapes (including every arm of the two
loops: the empty body, the `''` escape, a simple escape, a hex escape) and
the neighbours that must not move — the multi-line keys the one-line
reading refutes, which the scanner rejects at §7.4 in BOTH pipelines.
