/-! # The collection's tail behind still-open mapping levels
    (DOCS item 169)

Item 168 read the corpus's 76 dedenting landings by DROP DEPTH — 68 stand on
one open mapping level, 8 on two — and paid the ONE branch that depth named:
the compact key on the `-`'s own line, one level deep.  What that census did
not read is the ENTRY HEAD, and the two are independent.  §2's census reads
both at once and re-sizes the item: the fused face reached **67** of the 76,
not 68 — one of the one-level landings closes an entry whose `-` stands ALONE
on its line, so its key LANDS (`[185]` reaches the mapping through
`s-l+block-node`) and the compact branch that carried item 168's face never
runs.

Framing the lane pays the landed head and the two-level family with one move:
the face becomes `ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke)` — item 108's bottom
parameter on a THIRD lane, beside the stream and the explicit value line — and
`ks` lists the still-open mapping levels between the innermost one and the
collection.  No cover rides here, unlike item 148's: the only consumer of this
list is a `-` landing back at the collection's own width, and that landing
closes every level (`ResumeFrames.close`) — no width is ever tested for
membership.

§1 pins the three newly-reached families at the runtime, §2 records the
censuses, §3 states the hops at the types the proof composes them at and then
the two-level family end to end, §4 says what is paid and what is not. -/

Each landing's park stack beside the levels its unwind drops, and the events
beside both.  Every one emits ONE document whose sequence takes the landing as
its next ENTRY. -/

-- The LANDED head, one level (`examples/2/example-2.4.yaml`'s shape): the `-`
-- stands alone, so its mapping arrives through `[185] s-l+block-node` and the
-- key crosses a break.  ONE of the corpus's 76 — and the one that shows depth
-- and head are independent readings.

/-! ## §2  The corpus

`Scratch/CensusEntryHead.lean` (gitignored) re-reads item 166's dedenting
landings with BOTH axes at once — drop depth × how the entry's `-` opened:

    d1compact=67  d1alone=1  d1unk=0
    d2compact=3   d2alone=5  d2unk=0

Item 168's face lived on the compact branch at one width, so it reached
`d1compact` alone: **67 of 76**, where its own drop-depth census read 68.  The
other nine are this item: the one landed head at depth one
(`examples/2/example-2.4.yaml` L5), and all eight two-level landings.

`Scratch/CensusDrop2.lean` lists the eight: every one is
`drop=[2M,4M] at=[0S] pen=value` in `examples/other/anchors-aliases.yaml` (3,
compact) and `…/anchors-aliases2.yaml` (5, landed) — a mapping two deep inside
a sequence entry, the park a value's content both times.
`Scratch/CensusAloneList.lean` names the six landed heads: example-2.4's one,
and anchors-aliases2's five. -/

/-! ## §3  The route

The hops item 168 did not have, at the types the proof composes them at, and
then the two-level family whole. -/

-- Ⓐ **The landed head is the entry closure read through `[185]`'s node
-- alternative** — `accum_content_on_pendingBlock{,_indented}`'s payment of
-- `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch.h_nodeSF`.  The frames bottom out at once: the
-- entry's own level is the first mapping level there is.
example {sp_start sp_scan : SurfPos} {n : Nat}
    (h : ∀ sp_mid, SBlockIndented n .blockIn sp_scan sp_mid →
      SeqEntryTail sp_start n sp_mid) :
    -- Item 179: the entry's node reads at the SHIFTED index.
    ∀ sp_m, SBlockNode (n + 1) .blockIn sp_scan sp_m →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start n) [] sp_m :=
  fun sp_m h_bn =>
    ResumeFrames.bottom sp_m (h sp_m (SBlockIndented.node n .blockIn sp_scan sp_m h_bn))

-- Ⓑ **A `pendingMapValue` conses its own level on** — the payment at
-- `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented`'s dispatch sites: the awaited
-- node is this entry's value, behind it the entry's `[187]` level at `n` stays
-- tail-open, and below that stands whatever the park already carries.
example {sp_start sp_scan : SurfPos} {n ke : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_lt : ∀ k' ∈ ks, k' < n)
    (seqF : ∀ sp_mid, SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_mid →
      ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail n sp_mid sp_e →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) ks sp_e) :
    ∀ sp_m, SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_m →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) (n :: ks) sp_m :=
  fun sp_m h_bn =>
    ResumeFrames.level n ks sp_m h_lt (fun sp_end h_tail => seqF sp_m h_bn sp_end h_tail)

-- Ⓒ **The landed key closes the awaited node under the frames** —
-- `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`'s landed-branch spend of `h_nodeSF`, the same
-- `nestedBlockMap` composition as item 99's `h_nodeF`, at the framed codomain.
example {sp_start sp_scan sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {n w ke : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (hnw : n ≤ w)
    (h_ssl : SSLComments sp_scan sp_land)
    (h_ind' : SIndent w sp_land sp_key)
    (nodeSF : ∀ sp_m, SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_m →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) ks sp_m) :
    ∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry w sp_key sp_v →
    ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail w sp_v sp_e →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) ks sp_e :=
  fun _sp_v h_entry sp_e h_tail =>
    nodeSF sp_e (nestedBlockMap hnw h_ssl
      (SBlockMapEntries_of_compactTail h_ind' h_entry h_tail))

-- Ⓓ **The sibling landing conses at the frames** — `resumeMapRouteF` at the
-- `SeqEntryTail` bottom, the THIRD instantiation of item 108's parameter.
-- This is where item 168's `seqEntryTail_mapCons` went: the lane stopped
-- needing a lemma of its own.
example {sp_start sp_land sp_key : SurfPos} {k ke : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_ind : SIndent k sp_land sp_key)
    (h_seq : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail k sp_land sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) ks sp_end) :
    ∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry k sp_key sp_v →
    ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail k sp_v sp_e →
      ResumeFrames (SeqEntryTail sp_start ke) ks sp_e :=
  resumeMapRouteF h_ind h_seq

-- Ⓔ **The dedenting `-` closes every frame and conses** — the landing reads
-- the park's face at the innermost level's empty tail, `ResumeFrames.close`
-- ends each listed level the same way, and what is left is item 167's
-- `seqEntryTail_cons`.  No membership test anywhere: this consumer closes the
-- list whole, which is why the lane carries no cover.
example {sp_start sp_scan sp_mid sp_sc sp_scan' : SurfPos} {ke kk : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (seqF : ∀ sp_m, SSLComments sp_scan sp_m →
      ∀ sp_e, SCompactMapTail kk sp_m sp_e →

/-! ## §4  What is paid, and what is not

The framed face replaces the fused one on every carrier item 168 built —
`ImplicitKeyPack`'s fourth twin, `pendingMapValue.h_seqF`,
`pendingContent.h_seqF`, `ResumeKeyCtx`, `content_dispatch_routed`'s resuming
context, the block-landing dispatcher — so the one-width readings survive as
the `ks = []` instance and no producer got weaker.

New payments.  `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch` gains `h_nodeSF` (the LANDED key's
sequence face, hop Ⓐ's shape at `≤ n` because the list may include `n`
itself), spent at its landed branch (hop Ⓒ); the two `pendingBlock` dispatch
arms and the root site pay it from `h_close_entry_old` through
`SBlockIndented.node` with the frames bottomed — the landed head's whole
difference from the compact one.  `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented`
pays it with its own level consed on (hop Ⓑ), which is what reaches a mapping
two levels inside the entry.  The ROOT `pendingMapValue` arm punts: a value at
index 0 is the root mapping's, and no sequence entry encloses it.

`seqEntryTail_mapCons` is DELETED — the sibling cons is `resumeMapRouteF` at
the third instantiation of item 108's bottom parameter (hop Ⓓ).

No cover rides this lane, and that is a difference in KIND from item 148's
frames: `resumeAt` funds a membership test, and this lane's only consumer
closes every level (`ResumeFrames.close`, hop Ⓔ) — no width is compared, so
there is nothing for a cover to pay for.

What is punted, in the corpus's own numbers: nothing the corpus contains —
67 + 1 + 8 = 76 of 76 dedenting landings now have their producer path.  Still
open from item 167: the sequence-crossing dedent (`dropSeq = 0`, no input),
and — outside this lane entirely — the `[210]` flip's same five construction
sites. -/
