/-! # The auto-detected width has no floor, and the truncation is why (DOCS item 107)

`[183] l+block-sequence(n)` and `[187] l+block-mapping(n)` are
`( s-indent(n+m) … )+` for some auto-detected **`m > 0`**.  `SBlockNode.blockSeq`
and `.blockMap` bind that `m` as a bare `Nat` (item 22 bound it at the right
SCOPE — Reflection 647 — and left its RANGE open), which is row 19's fourth
over-approximation, recorded 2026-08-16 and carried unpriced ever since with the
note "harmless at the root".

This file prices it.  The parameter cannot simply be tightened, because in this
encoding `m = 0` is doing THREE different jobs and only one of them is the
over-approximation:

* the ROOT's own mapping — `a: 1` at column 0 — is `SBlockNode 0`, and its
  entries are at column 0, so the constructor's `n + m` forces `m = 0`.  The
  spec has no such case: the document node is `s-l+block-node(-1, block-in)`,
  so `-1 + 1 = 0` with `m = 1`.
* the SEQ-SPACES key — `?⏎- a`, whose `-` sits at the `?`'s own column — is
  `[201] seq-spaces(n, block-out) = n-1`, which at `n = 0` is the spec's `-1`
  and here is `0 - 1 = 0`.  Truncating subtraction, so again `m = 0`.
* the EQUAL-WIDTH landing — `k:⏎  a: 1⏎  b: 2`'s second key — is the one the
  spec really forbids: a mapping nested inside its enclosing entry at that
  entry's own width, where `parseYaml` reads a SIBLING.

`Nat` cannot tell the first two from the third, and §2 says why in one line:
`seq-spaces` collides at exactly the two indices that matter.  So `0 < m` is not
a one-line tightening of a parameter — it is a re-indexing of `SBlockNode`, and
the plan row that reads "4 construction sites" is pricing the wrong thing.
**Item 179 landed that re-indexing** — three crossings add the one
(`SBlockIndented.node`, `implicitKeyNode`, `emptyKeyNode`), and §§4–5 below
read the same terms at the landed convention.

Everything below is either a RUNTIME pin (no runtime file is touched at this
item) or a TERM whose elaboration is the fact. -/

/-! ## §2 The collision

`[201] seq-spaces(n,c)` is `n-1` in block-out and `n` in block-in, and `n` is a
`Nat` here, so the subtraction truncates.  It truncates at exactly one index —
and that index is the root's. -/

example : seqSpaces 0 .blockOut = 0 := rfl
example : seqSpaces 1 .blockOut = 0 := rfl
/-- The spec's `-1` and the spec's `0` are the same `Nat`. -/
example : seqSpaces 0 .blockOut = seqSpaces 1 .blockOut := rfl
/-- And nowhere else: above the collision the map is injective again. -/
example : seqSpaces 2 .blockOut ≠ seqSpaces 1 .blockOut := by decide
example : seqSpaces 3 .blockOut = 2 := rfl
/-- Block-in never subtracts, so its floor is the honest `n < E`. -/
example (n : Nat) : seqSpaces n .blockIn = n := rfl

/-! ## §3 What each family needs of `m`

The constructor's entries index is `seqSpaces n c + m` (sequence) and `n + m`
(mapping), so each family's own width IS an equation in `m`.  Two of the three
solve to `m = 0`. -/

/-- The ROOT mapping: `n = 0` and entries at column 0. -/
example {s s₂ s' : SurfPos} (h_ssl : SSLComments s s₂)
    (h_entries : SBlockMapEntries 0 s₂ s') : SBlockNode 0 .blockIn s s' :=
  SBlockNode.blockMap 0 .blockIn 0 s s s₂ s' (GOpt.none s) h_ssl h_entries

/-- The SEQ-SPACES key: `n = 0` in block-out and the `-` at column 0. -/
example {s s₂ s' : SurfPos} (h_ssl : SSLComments s s₂)
    (h_entries : SBlockSeqEntries 0 s₂ s') : SBlockNode 0 .blockOut s s' :=
  SBlockNode.blockSeq 0 .blockOut 0 s s s₂ s' (GOpt.none s) h_ssl h_entries

/-- Neither has another solution: the spec's own `m > 0` is unreachable at
    index 0 for as long as the index expression is `n + m` over `Nat`. -/
example : ¬ ∃ m : Nat, 0 < m ∧ 0 + m = 0 := by omega

/-! ## §4 The over-approximation — RETIRED by the convention (item 179)

`nestedBlockMap`'s side condition is `n ≤ k` — item 39's, and the whole content
of the landed/dedent split at `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`.  With `SBlockNode`'s
index shifted, `n` in that slot names the spec's `n - 1`, so `n ≤ k` READS as
the spec's own strict floor `n_spec < k`.  The equal-width landing no longer
reaches it at all: an entry at raw column `e` awaits its node at `e + 1`, so a
landing at `k = e` fails `e + 1 ≤ k` and joins the dedent branch — the sibling
reading, which is the parser's.  The `Nat.le_refl` term below still
elaborates, and what it now constructs is honest: entries exactly one
spec-level deeper than the slot's index — the root's own shape. -/

example {n : Nat} {s s₂ s' : SurfPos} (h_ssl : SSLComments s s₂)
    (h_entries : SBlockMapEntries n s₂ s') : SBlockNode n .blockIn s s' :=
  nestedBlockMap (Nat.le_refl n) h_ssl h_entries

/-- The honest half of the same split — a STRICTLY deeper landing — is the one
    the spec's `m > 0` would keep, and it is already what every non-degenerate
    caller passes. -/
example {n k : Nat} (hlt : n < k) {s s₂ s' : SurfPos} (h_ssl : SSLComments s s₂)
    (h_entries : SBlockMapEntries k s₂ s') : SBlockNode n .blockIn s s' :=
  nestedBlockMap (Nat.le_of_lt hlt) h_ssl h_entries

/-! ## §5 The price — PAID (item 179)

Tightening `m` means giving the two collection constructors a FLOOR on their
entries' width, and the convention pays it with no side condition at all: at
`n_lean = n_spec + 1` uniformly, a block-in collection's `n + m` entries sit
at or above `n = n_spec + 1 > n_spec` even at `m = 0`, a block-out sequence's
`seqSpaces n .blockOut + m = (n - 1) + m` sits at or above the spec's
`seq-spaces` value (the `-1` that keeps `?⏎- a` legal), and the ROOT is
`SBlockNode 0` — the spec's `-1` — whose entries at column 0 are the honest
`m = 0`.  What carried the price was not these constructors but the three
CROSSINGS that feed them raw columns, and the proof surface behind them
(item 179's ledger row has the census: 75 sites, 13 definitions, all in
`StreamAccum`).  `widthFloor` below is the floor §5 originally asked for,
kept as the arithmetic the convention now provides for free. -/

/-- The floors, as they would have to read. -/
private def widthFloor (n : Nat) (c : YamlContext) : Nat :=
  match c with
  | .blockOut => n
  | _ => n + 1

/-- They admit the equal-width landing's honest twin … -/
example (n k : Nat) (h : n < k) : widthFloor n .blockIn ≤ k := by
  simp [widthFloor]; omega
/-- … and refuse the landing itself, which is the point … -/
example (n : Nat) : ¬ (widthFloor n .blockIn ≤ n) := by simp [widthFloor]
/-- … and they keep the seq-spaces key, whose `-` is at the `?`'s own column … -/
example (n : Nat) : widthFloor n .blockOut ≤ n := by simp [widthFloor]
/-- … while the ROOT falls to the same refusal as the over-approximation, being
    indexed `0` where the spec indexes it `-1`. -/
example : ¬ (widthFloor 0 .blockIn ≤ 0) := by simp [widthFloor]
