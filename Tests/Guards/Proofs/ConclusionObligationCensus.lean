/-! # The obligation census (DOCS item 228)

Item 227 counted **27** declarations whose CONCLUSION `Or.inr trivial` proves,
and stopped there deliberately: "pick one of the 27 and narrow its CONCLUSION
— the operation that turns a theorem `Or.inr trivial` would prove into an
obligation, which is the only way to find out what the obligation costs."

This file is that operation and its price.

**Five of `FlowKeyLift`'s ten are narrowed** (`plain_toKey`,
`doubleQuoted_toKey`, `singleQuoted_toKey`, `sep_toKey`, and the
`sep_toBlockKey` relay): their `∨ True` is now `∨ <residue>`, read off the arm
each proof actually takes.  §5's re-run of item 227's own instrument reads
**22**, in both directions, which is the machine's receipt for the operation.

**What it cost.**  `scripts/narrow_conclusion.py` narrows a conclusion to
`∨ False` — the tightest narrowing there is, so the error count bounds what
ANY narrowing must pay — and lets `lake build` answer.  Over the 25 of the 27
that are lemmas at all, the answer is **182 sites**: 97 in `FlowKeyLift`, 84 in
`StreamAccum`, 1 in `PreprocessIndentStable`.  Three readings no earlier item
could make:

* **The price is mostly RELAY DAMAGE, not residue.**  `frameChainUnion` writes
  `Or.inr trivial` NOWHERE — its term census reads `res=0` — and narrowing its
  conclusion costs **11**, of which **10 are in other declarations**, spread
  from line 6618 to line 30527 of one module.  `flowKeyHead` is the same shape:
  1 own, 4 downstream.  **Narrowing a conclusion does not stop at the lemma.**
* **The obligation is concentrated.**  83 of `FlowKeyLift`'s 97 are in ONE
  lemma, `flowNode_toKey`.
* **A cheap probe under-prices it forty-fold.**  Narrowing only
  `flowNode_toKey`'s conclusion costs **2**: its proof is a single application
  of the flow grammar's 18-motive recursor, so the elaborator reports one
  mismatch for the whole term and the 83 sites stay hidden behind the eight
  `∨ True` MOTIVES.  An error count is a fact about how a proof is WRITTEN
  before it is a fact about the obligation.

**What it bought, and what it did not.**  §2.  The narrowing is worth exactly
the consumer's ability to REFUTE the residue, and `True` can never be refuted
(`true_residue_is_irrefutable`).  Three of the four new residues consume a line
break by construction; the separation's arm does not, and §2 exhibits a span
that satisfies the arm AND the left disjunct at once.  **A narrowed residue
that overlaps its own left disjunct is not yet an obligation.**  Whether the
other three are tight was UNSETTLED here: saying "this derivation consumed a
break INSIDE this span" needs a suffix lemma over the flow grammar, and §4
measured that the library had **none**.

Item 229 wrote that lemma and item 230 re-proved `sep_toKey` around a residue
that does not overlap — except at the end of the input, where every separation
is inline and the input has run out at once.  §2 proves both halves: the
overlap is gone at every span a key consumer can be at, and it is still there
at end of input, which is a span a key consumer is never at.

**Item 231 rebuilt the eighteen motives**, and it turns the third reading above
into a measurement rather than a caution: the 83 sites the cheap probe hid
behind the motives cost **82** widening terms to discharge, one per
`Or.inr`, and this census's `res` fell from **123** to **58** with a single
row leaving.  The reading holds in the other direction too.
`flowContent_toBlockKey` is not a motive — it recovers the CONTENT conversion
by inverting the NODE one — and its `res=4` did not move at all, while its
`imp` fell by exactly the one `∨ True` the inverted result used to carry.
**A residue reaches the conclusion it is proved about; it does not reach the
conclusions derived from that one by inversion.**

/-! ## §1 The ladder's third rung

Item 226's first rung: a PREMISE `A ∨ True` is unconditionally inhabited, so it
buys nothing.  Item 227's second: narrowing it to `A` buys nothing either where
`A` is itself unconditionally inhabited.  Both are about premises.

Read on the CONCLUSION side the same two facts say something sharper.  A
conclusion `A ∨ True` is not a weak theorem about `A`; it is not a theorem
about `A` at all, because the proof that discharges it need not look at the
hypotheses.  And what a narrowing buys is exactly one thing — a consumer that
can REFUTE the residue gets the left disjunct — which is why `True` buys
nothing: no consumer can ever supply `¬ True`. -/

/-- A conclusion `A ∨ True` is proved without reading the hypotheses. -/
lemma noop_conclusion_ignores_hypotheses {P A : Prop} : P → (A ∨ True) :=
  fun _ => Or.inr trivial

/-- …so the statement IS the trivial one, whatever `A` is. -/
lemma noop_conclusion_is_trivial {A : Prop} : (A ∨ True) ↔ True :=
  ⟨fun _ => trivial, fun _ => Or.inr trivial⟩

/-- **What a narrowing buys**: a consumer that refutes the residue gets the
    left disjunct.  This is the whole content of the operation. -/
lemma narrowed_conclusion_pays {A R : Prop} (h : A ∨ R) (hr : ¬ R) : A :=
  h.resolve_right hr

/-- **…and why `True` buys nothing**: `¬ True` is uninhabited, so the right arm
    of `A ∨ True` is unreachable from every consumer, for ever. -/
lemma true_residue_is_irrefutable : ¬ (¬ (True : Prop)) :=
  fun h => h trivial

/-- The two together, as an iff: for a left disjunct that is not already free,
    `A ∨ R` yields `A` exactly when `R` is refutable. -/
lemma conclusion_eliminable_iff {A R : Prop} (hA : ¬ A) :
    ((A ∨ R) → A) ↔ ¬ R :=
  ⟨fun k hr => hA (k (Or.inr hr)), fun hr k => k.resolve_right hr⟩

/-! ## §2 The narrowing, performed — and one residue that is not an obligation

At item 228 `sep_toKey` declined on `[70] s-separate-lines(n)`'s
comment-delimited arm, `SepCommentedArm`.  The arm is NOT "the separation
crossed a line": `[79] s-l-comments` has a comment-free `startOfLine` arm and
`[63] s-indent(0)` consumes nothing, so at a zero-width span at column 0 the
arm holds — and so does `[80] s-separate-in-line`, by its own `startOfLine`
arm.  **Both disjuncts are true at the same span**, which is exactly what a
narrowing is supposed to stop being true.

The module docstring of `FlowKeyLift` said the `True` side was "taken exactly
on a multi-line interior"; for the separation that is imprecise, and it is
corrected there, at item 228.

The other three residues (`PlainResidue`, `DoubleResidue`, `SingleResidue`)
each carry a `[28] b-break` or a `[29] b-non-content` in their own components,
so the same overlap is not available — but proving that they are DISJOINT from
their left disjunct needs "this derivation consumed a break inside this span",
and §4 measures that the instrument for that sentence does not exist.  They are
UNSETTLED, which is not a negative result. -/

/-- **The arm at a zero-width start-of-line span.** -/
lemma sepCommentedArm_of_startOfLine (chars : List Char) :
    SepCommentedArm 0 ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ :=
  ⟨⟨chars, 0⟩, SSLComments.startOfLine chars _ (GStar.nil _),
    SFlowLinePrefix.mk 0 _ _ _ (SIndent.zero _) (GOpt.none _)⟩

/-- **…and the left disjunct at the same span**: read as a residue, the arm
    does not partition `sep_toKey`'s input. -/
lemma sep_arm_does_not_partition (chars : List Char) :
    SSeparate 0 .blockKey ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ ∧
      SepCommentedArm 0 ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ :=
  ⟨SSeparateInLine.startOfLine _, sepCommentedArm_of_startOfLine chars⟩

/-- The narrowed lemma still has its left disjunct available there, so the
    overlap was never a gap in `sep_toKey` — it is a statement that the arm is
    weaker than the name it carried. -/
lemma sep_toKey_at_startOfLine (chars : List Char) :
    SSeparate 0 .blockKey ⟨chars, 0⟩ ⟨chars, 0⟩ :=
  (sep_arm_does_not_partition chars).1

/-- **Item 230's residue does not overlap at that span.**  `SepResidue` is
    false at every zero-width span with input left, so `sep_toKey` returns the
    conversion there and nothing else. -/
lemma sepResidue_false_at_zero_width (ch : Char) (rest : List Char) :
    ¬ SepResidue ⟨ch :: rest, 0⟩ ⟨ch :: rest, 0⟩ := by
  rintro (⟨pre, hspan, c, hmem, -⟩ | he)
  · have hpre : pre = [] := by
      simp only [L4YAML.Proofs.SurfaceSpan.Span] at hspan
      simpa using hspan.symm
    exact absurd (hpre ▸ hmem) (by simp)
  · exact absurd he (by simp [atEnd])

/-- **…and where it still does, volunteered.**  At the end of the input every
    separation is inline and `atEnd` holds, so the two disjuncts are both true
    there.  That span is one a key consumer is never at — a key is followed by
    a `:` — which is why the residue is refutable although it is not
    disjoint. -/
lemma sepResidue_overlaps_at_eof (col : Nat) :
    SSeparate 0 .blockKey ⟨[], col⟩ ⟨[], col⟩ ∧ SepResidue ⟨[], col⟩ ⟨[], col⟩ :=
  ⟨SSeparateInLine.startOfLine _, Or.inr rfl⟩

/-! ## §2b Is the new residue itself vacuous?

Item 227's whole finding was that a narrowing buys nothing where the narrowed
face is unconditionally inhabited, so the first question to ask of a residue is
the one item 227 asked of a face.  Both of that item's witnesses are tried
here — `trivial`, and the empty-list prover
`⟨[], fun _ h => absurd h List.not_mem_nil⟩` that settled 22 of its 163 — and
neither settles any of the four, nor is any of them an `_ ∨ True` in disguise.

This is a NEGATIVE result about two specific provers and not a proof that the
residues are uninhabited; `sepCommentedArm_of_startOfLine` shows the arm is
inhabited at a whole family of spans, and `sepResidue_overlaps_at_eof` shows
item 230's replacement is inhabited too.

**The population is read off the CONCLUSIONS, corrected at item 230.**  This
selected by name — any declaration in `FlowKeyLift` whose name ends in
`Residue` — and that is not a property of a residue.  Item 230 added three
payment lemmas called `sep_toKey_of_noResidue`, `sepOpt_toKey_of_noResidue`
and `props_toKey_of_noResidue`, and the probe's population went from 4 to 7
without a residue being added: a name test measures naming.  The four are now
collected as the right disjuncts of the file's own `∨`-conclusions, named by
this file — which is what a residue IS.  Their tallies were unaffected — the three intruders have a
conclusion that is not a sort, so they scored zero on all three — and that is
the shape of the failure to watch for: a bad population that the tallies hide.

/-! ## §3 The obligation ledger

For every declaration item 227's instrument still selects, four numbers read
off the proof TERM and the environment: `res` — distinct subterms
`@Or.inr A True _ True.intro`; `imp` — the `∨ True` subterms the term carries
in a motive or an intermediate type; `prem` — `_ ∨ True` BINDERS in the type,
which is item 227's own population; `proj` — the declaration is a projection
and not a lemma at all.

`res` is a DAG count and undercounts by sharing: at item 228 `props_toKey`
wrote `Or.inr trivial` in two branches over the same span, so the two terms
were structurally identical and this walk saw one where the compiler saw two.
That is why `scripts/narrow_conclusion.py` exists, and why its number is the
one DOCS quotes. -/

/-- The rows, machine-produced, sorted by `res` then `prem` descending.  Three
    rows are all-zero — the proof never reaches the right arm by any route —
    and two of those three are PROJECTIONS, so their "conclusion" is a park
    FIELD and narrowing it is the supply-side operation items 212-218 priced,
    not this one.

    **Item 230 took one row off the list** (`FlowKeyLift.props_toKey`) and
    **item 231 took two more** — `flowNode_toKey`, which held 65 of the 123,
    and `flowNode_toBlockKey`, which held none.  That is what a narrowing looks
    like in this census: a row leaves, it does not shrink.

    One surviving row DID shrink, and it is the item's finding:
    `FlowKeyLift.flowContent_toBlockKey` reads `imp=11`, down from 12, because
    the `flowNode_toBlockKey` result it inverts is no longer an `_ ∨ True`.  Its
    own `res=4` did not move: the peel has four arms, the node conversion rules
    out none of them, and so its `Or.inr` still has nothing but `trivial` to
    return.  A residue that reaches a conclusion does not reach the conclusions
    derived from it BY INVERSION. -/

/-! ## §4 What stopped the other five, and what it cost

`flowNode_toKey`'s residue arises at an INTERIOR span and its conclusion is
about the OUTER one, so the only proposition that could carry it out is one
about the SPAN — "the characters between `s` and `s'` contain a break".  Saying
that needs `s'.chars` to be a suffix of `s.chars` for every production in the
flow grammar, and this counts what that takes: the mutual block's size, and how
many such lemmas the library has.

At item 228 the third number was **0**, and it was the reason five rows of §3
could not be paid.  Item 229 built the family —
`L4YAML/Proofs/Foundation/SurfaceSpan.lean` — so it now reads **18**, one per
type of the block.  The first two numbers are unmoved, which is the point of
keeping this gate: the instrument was priced at 69 arms by signatures BEFORE it
existed, and the block it walks is still exactly 69 arms. -/
