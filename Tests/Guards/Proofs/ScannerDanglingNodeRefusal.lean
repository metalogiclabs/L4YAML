/-! # The dangling node run, refused at the scanner (DOCS item 133)

§9.2 `[211] l-yaml-stream` has no production for a node that belongs to nothing.
A trailing `[96]* (scalar|alias)?` run whose START sits at an OPEN indent
level's own column is exactly that shape: the level is already occupied by the
collection that opened it, so the run is neither that collection's next key nor
any indicator's content.  Item 119 measured the refusal as the parser's and
named the migration M2; this is the landing.

`scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode` runs BEFORE the structural dispatch — a
dangler dies at a `...`/`---` too, and the marker would otherwise consume the
step — and `scanLoop_checkDanglingNode` runs beside `scanLoop`'s other two final
validations, for the run the stream itself ends.  The mid-stream check takes TWO
states since item 140: the break off the landing, the RUN off the state the
landing arrived with, because preprocessing's unwind displaces the run from the
array it would otherwise be read in.  See
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ScannerDanglingNodeDedent.lean`.

**What separates a dangler from a value is its PREDECESSOR**, and the three that
offer a slot are `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`'s: `:`, `?` and `-`, whose own
productions are followed by `s-l+block-node`/`s-l+block-indented`.  So `a:⏎b` is
`{a: b}`, `?⏎b⏎: v` is the explicit key's content and `-⏎b` is the entry's,
while `a: 1⏎b` has a finished scalar behind it and no slot at all.

**The mid-stream check needs the break; the EOF one does not.**  A run still on
its own line may yet be resolved by a `:` (`a: 1⏎b: 2` — `b` becomes a key), and
`simpleKeyAllowed` is down there; at the end of input there is no `:` left to
come, so the flag is not asked for.  §2 pins both arms.

**The position reported is the RUN's start, not the cursor's** — that is where
the offending node begins, and where the parser reported.  §4 pins it.

§1 types the check and the four ways it stands aside.  §2 is the refused family.
§3 is the boundary.  §4 is the identity of the refusal.  §5 is the
discrimination from M1 and M3. -/

/-! ## §1  The check, and the four ways it stands aside -/

/-- Inside a flow collection there are no block levels to dangle at. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (h : s.inFlow = true) : danglingNodePos? s = none := by
  simp only [danglingNodePos?, h, ↓reduceIte]

/-- An array that does not end in a node run has no dangler in it. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (h : trailingNodeRun? s.tokens = none) :
    danglingNodePos? s = none := by
  unfold danglingNodePos?
  split
  · rfl
  · rw [h]

/-- A flow close ends no run: `]`/`}` are neither a node body nor a `[96]`
    property, which is what separates `isNodeBody` from `completesFlowValue`. -/
example : YamlToken.isNodeBody .flowSequenceEnd = false := rfl
example : YamlToken.isNodeBody .flowMappingEnd = false := rfl
example : YamlToken.completesFlowValue .flowSequenceEnd = true := rfl

/-- The three predecessors that OFFER the run a slot. -/
example : YamlToken.offersNodeSlot .value = true := rfl
example : YamlToken.offersNodeSlot .key = true := rfl
example : YamlToken.offersNodeSlot .blockEntry = true := rfl
example : YamlToken.offersNodeSlot (.scalar "x" .plain) = false := rfl
example : YamlToken.offersNodeSlot .flowSequenceEnd = false := rfl

/-- Mid-stream the break is required, and `simpleKeyAllowed` is it — read off
    the LANDING, which is the second of the check's two states (item 140). -/
example (s_run s_land : ScannerState) (h : s_land.simpleKeyAllowed = false) :
    scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode s_run s_land = .ok () := by
  simp only [scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode, h, Bool.false_eq_true, ↓reduceIte]

/-- At EOF it is not: the stream itself ended the run. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (p : YamlPos) (h : danglingNodePos? s = some p) :
    scanLoop_checkDanglingNode s = .error (.invalidBareDocument p.line p.col) := by
  simp only [scanLoop_checkDanglingNode, h]

/-! ## §5  The discrimination from M1 and M3

    M1 (`ScannerBareDocumentRefusal`) is the completed ROOT document, where the
    indent stack is the sentinel alone; M2 is a run at an OPEN level's column.
    The two never overlap, because a column is a `Nat` and the sentinel's is
    `-1`.  M3 — the `-` at a mapping top's own column with the entry complete —
    landed at item 134, and this check stands aside on its whole family for the
    reason §1 gives: the trailing run's PREDECESSOR offers it a slot (`k` is the
    explicit key's content, `1` is `a`'s value), so nothing is dangling.  What
    has no slot is the `-` in front of it, and that is
    `scanBlockEntryValidate`'s question, not this one's. -/

-- M1's family: the root, refused by the OTHER check, at the node's own column.
#guard saysAlike "[1, 2]\na\n" 1 0
#guard saysAlike "\"x\"\na\n" 1 0
-- M3's family: the same message, at the `-`, from all four layers — and the
-- slot-offering predecessor that keeps THIS check out of it.
#guard saysAlike "a: 1\n- y\n" 1 0
#guard saysAlike "? k\n- y\n" 1 0
#guard saysAlike ": v\n- y\n" 1 0
