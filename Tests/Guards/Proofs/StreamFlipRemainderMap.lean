/-! # The flip's remainder, mapped (DOCS items 171–179)

Row 19's 1c ends by narrowing `[210]`'s slot (`GOpt SLAnyDocument` →
`GOpt SLExplicitDocument`), and the narrowing instrument breaks FIVE
definitions: `topLevelFlowResumeSep`, `rootMapRoute`, `rootMapRouteF`,
`bareNodeRoute` — the four raw routes that append a completed construct to the
stream as a fresh BARE document — and `structural_dispatch_to_pending`, whose
breaking site passes `SLAnyDocument.explicit` and is the wrapper the flip
itself deletes.  Every consumer arm that still reaches a raw route is one of:

* the four guards' own fallback arms (`*_or_refused` at `Or.inr` and at a
  landing resting ON an open level),
* `flowKeyRoute_of_root`'s no-break arm,
* `content_dispatch_after_close`'s route,
* `accum_content_pending`'s two crossed-window arms (item 170's), and
* `bareNodeRoute_or_refused_content`'s two fallback arms.

This file pins the INPUT families those arms serve, at the runtime, one
`#guard` per family — so the map is measured, and any runtime move flips it
loudly.  Item 171 measured the map and named two findings; item 172 closed the
second, and the pins below are the map at the CLOSED state:

**The value at its own level's column (§4) is REFUSED as of item 177 —
Finding A's runtime floor.**  Every alternative of `[196] s-l+block-node(n,c)`
and `[185] s-l+block-indented(n,c)` that a scalar or alias can head spends
`s-separate(n+1)`, whose line-crossing branch demands `s-indent(n+1)` —
column `n` fails it — so a props-less scalar or alias run standing at an open
level's own column refuses at the scanner (`danglingNodePos?`, whose
slot-offered exemption item 177 narrowed to the run shapes other readings
own), with the same `invalidBareDocument` constructor and run-start position
the slot-LESS twin `a: 1⏎b` has always gotten.  The refusal covers plain,
quoted, and block-scalar forms and the alias, at any depth, mid-stream, and
in implicit and explicit entries alike; `[201] seq-spaces` keeps the sequence
(`k:⏎- a` arrives as a `-` indicator, not a run).  **Item 178 is the same
floor's `[96]` half**: the properties sit inside the same alternatives,
behind the same `s-separate(n+1)`, so a props-HEADED run at the column
refuses at the same check too — `k:⏎&x a` and the props-headed flow tail
`k:⏎&x [1]⏎: b` move from the parser's `trailingContent` to the scanner, and
the `-`/`?` faces (`-⏎&x a`, `?⏎&x a⏎: v`), which rode the exemption into
outright acceptance, flip to the refusal.  The exemption keeps only the
props-less flow-close tail, whose refusals are item 172's floor and whose
sibling-key readings never present a break-ended run.  PyYAML (6.x,
`yaml.parse`, event level) refuses every one of these at its scanner ("could
not find expected ':'") EXCEPT the block-scalar header forms (`k:⏎|⏎ x`),
which it accepts against `[199]`'s own `s-separate(n+1)` — item 177's one
named PyYAML gap, and the props-headed twin `k:⏎&x |⏎ x` is refused even
there (the `&x` is what PyYAML's scanner trips on); the one suite case in
any family is G9HC (`seq:⏎&anchor⏎- a`), an error case whose refusal moves
stage only.  **Item 179 landed the ENCODING half** — `SBlockNode` reads
`n_lean = n_spec + 1` through the three crossings that used to feed it raw
columns, `nestedBlockMap`'s `n ≤ k` is the spec's own strict floor at that
convention, and the equal-width landing's second derivation is gone
(`BlockCollectionWidthFloor.lean` §§4–5).  The runtime did not move at 179,
so every pin below is unchanged; what 179 leaves for the flip is one
acceptance that now survives ONLY through `[211]`'s bare continuation:
`k: &x⏎a` — the run parks DEEPER than the awaiting level (legal), the
content lands AT the level's column, and the attached reading
(`{k: &x a}`, the events pipeline's own) died with the re-index, so the
derivation left is the second-document over-approximation the flip deletes.
PyYAML refuses it; the run-start check cannot see it (the run is legal where
it stands); it joins the crossed-window arms on the flip's own prerequisite
list.  The FLOW half was never this floor's:
a flow node standing in the awaited slot at column `n` is item 172's refusal
(`underIndentedFlowContent`, §5), and the two readings stay disjoint by the
run's tail.

**The sibling implicit flow key (§5) is item 172's fix.**  `c-s-implicit-json-key`
is `c-flow-json-node(n/a, block-key)` — the flow key carries no indent
parameter — so a `[`/`{` landing AT an open level's column may be the level's
next KEY, and key-vs-value is not decidable at the open (item 159's own
measurement: a collection can head a key).  §8.1's floor is therefore read at
the CLOSE (`underIndentedFlowValuePos?`, the slot-offered complement of
`danglingNodePos?`): the same-line `:` after the close resolves the key half
through the simple key the close restores — the sibling entry, `a: 1⏎[1]: b`
= `{a: 1, [1]: b}`, exactly the reading the anchor-shifted twin
`a: 1⏎&p [b]: c` has always had — and a landing no `:` resolves refuses at
the break or EOF gate: as the awaited value's own under-indent where the slot
holder OFFERS a node (`k:⏎[1, 2]`, `underIndentedFlowContent` at the open's
position), and as §9.2's dangling node where it COMPLETES one (`a: 1⏎[1, 2]`,
`invalidBareDocument` — the same constructor the scalar twin `a: 1⏎b` gets,
and the same one the anchored twin `a: 1⏎&p [1, 2]` has always gotten). -/

/-! ## §1  The block lane: what `bareNodeRoute`'s holders serve

The guards' on-level arms (`rootMapRoute_or_refused`, `rootMapRouteF_or_refused`,
`bareNodeRoute_or_refused` at `h_op = true`, and `content_dispatch_after_close`)
serve exactly the SIBLING landings: a completed entry, a break, the next entry
at the same width.  Every accepted input here is one document read entry by
entry — the resume reading, not a second bare document — which is what the
arms must hand after the flip. -/

/-! …and the INDICATOR-headed siblings — the `:`/`?` opened at a still-open
level's own width, which is what item 173's resume arm at
`colon_open_map`/`question_open_map` serves.  One mapping each, the empty or
explicit key consed as the level's next entry — at the root, one level in,
and on the awaited-value park (`k:⏎: 2` = `{k: null, null: 2}`, the flow twin
of which is §5's `k:⏎[1]: b`).  References: the SUITE certifies the colon
family itself — 2JQS is `: a⏎: b` with exactly this one-mapping event list —
and `[192]`'s `e-node` key alternative is the production; PyYAML is NOT the
reference here (it refuses every empty implicit key, first entry included —
its known `[192]` gap), while it parses the `?` siblings with matching
events.  The dedent-crossing colon sibling (`a:⏎- x⏎: 2`) is the same
reading at the parser and the swap's RECORDED residue on the proof side: the
entry parks carry no mapping-lane frames, so that landing keeps the guarded
fallback until a carrier crosses the `-`'s close. -/

/-! ## §2  The flow lane after item 172: the key half resumes, the value half
refuses at the gate

`topLevelFlowResumeSep_or_refused`'s fallback arms and `flowKeyRoute_of_root`'s
landing arm serve the deferred floor's two halves.  The KEY half — a landing
flow open whose close a same-line `:` resolves — is the sibling entry, accepted
with the resume reading in both pipelines.  The VALUE half is refused at the
break or EOF gate: `invalidBareDocument` where the run's slot holder completes
a node (§9.2's own reading through the close, item 159's walk-back), and the
more-indented interior refuses by column exactly as before (item 145).

**Item 176 pays the key half on the proof side.**  `flowKeyRoute_of_root`'s
landing arm takes the park's still-open mapping levels (`h_mapF`, the shape
the `:`/`?` openers took at item 173) and spends the RESUME first — the
sibling flow key conses onto the level's own tail (`resumeMapRoute`) instead
of falling to `rootMapRoute_or_refused`'s bare second document — paid by
`pendingContent.h_framesS` and `pendingBlockContent.h_closeF` (read at the
empty tail, item 110's own spend) through the flow open's landing.  And the
entries-level TWIN rides on every arm now — item 120's punt-gate ("the bare
flow key at a level's own column is §8.1-refused") expired at item 172 — so
the park made after the flow-keyed entry's value offers the NEXT landing the
same resume: the chains below are one mapping end to end, on both the flow
lane (`[2]: b`) and the block lane (`c: 2`, through `flowKeyPack_of_close` →
`pendingMapValue.h_frames` → items 109/151's content machinery). -/

/-! Item 176's paid families, park by park: the explicit entry's completed
value, the block-scalar value, the sequence dedent (`h_closeF` at the empty
tail), and the anchored value all land the sibling flow key through the new
resume arm.  PyYAML (6.x, `yaml.parse`) parses every one of these with
matching events. -/

/-! …and the CHAINS the entries-level twin buys: the entry after the
flow-keyed one resumes too, on either lane.  The `...` chain rides the named
PyYAML suffix gap (item 175: PyYAML refuses ANY bare document after a `...`
suffix), so `[210]`'s text is the reference there; PyYAML parses the rest
with matching events. -/

(`flowKeyRoute_of_open`'s twins stay punts — the `c: 2` landing keeps the
guarded fallback until that boundary pays); the seq-spaces sibling (the
`pendingBlockContent n = 0` park's `h_closeF` bound `k' < n` cannot list the
level, item 173's dedent residue one lane over); and the awaited-value park's
sibling (`k:⏎[1]: b` — the nested `m = 0` reading the `pendingMapValue` arm
used to spend died with item 179's re-indexing; the landing now falls past
the strict split to the guarded fallback, and the honest sibling reading —
the one the events above already emit — stays the punt's own to pay). -/

`accum_content_pending`'s two `PropsWindowCross` fallbacks (item 170) apply the
raw route behind a window premise whose every scanner-reachable input the
parser refuses — `TokenParser.validNextToken`'s own §9.2 reading.  The full
window pins are `PropsCrossWindowRoute.lean`'s; the two families here are the
arms' whole domain.  Item 178 moved the OFFERED family's refusal into the
scanner — the window's first property stands at the awaiting level's own
column, which is now `danglingNodePos?`'s own reading at the first break —
so the crossed window is never reached there any more; the root family, whose
window has no offered slot, keeps the parser's refusal. -/

/-! ## §3b  Items 174–175 — the props ride across the break

`[161] ns-flow-node`'s third alternative separates the properties from the
content with `s-separate(n,c)`, which is `s-separate-lines` in every non-key
context — the BREAK IS INSIDE THE NODE.  So a sentinel-level `[96]` park's
break-crossed content is the run's OWN node, not an anchored-empty document
followed by a bare second one: the scalar and quoted forms ride `[161]`'s
props alternative, the block scalar rides `[198]`'s slot, and the implicit-key
mapping rides `[196] s-l+block-collection`'s optional properties — the
MAPPING's anchor (`+MAP &p`), where the same-line `&p b: 1` anchors the KEY
(`+MAP =VAL &p :b` — PyYAML agrees on both readings).  The ride bottoms in
the park's own route, so the seed, the marker and the suffix parks all ride
identically, and the explicit value's park (`? k⏎: &p⏎b` = `{k: &p b}`) is
the same `n = 0` swap — there PyYAML refuses at its simple-key scanner, a
PyYAML-side gap like `[192]`'s.

Item 174 paid the CONTENT-dispatch rides at the sentinel-indexed park.
**Item 175 paid the INDICATOR-dispatch rides**: a landed `-`/`?`/`:` opens
the RUN's own collection — `[196]`'s optional properties again, the
COLLECTION's anchor (`&p⏎- a` = `+SEQ &p`, where the same-line `&p - a` is
scanner-refused; `&p⏎? x⏎: v` and `&p⏎: v` = `+MAP &p`) — through the same
park route, carried as `PropsNodeRoute` (the ride's landing half): the FIFTH
arm of the `:`/`?` openers' cascades and the `-` arm's entries route
(`propsSeqRoute`).  PyYAML agrees on every accepted family below except its
three known gaps: the empty implicit key (`&p⏎: v` — `[192]`, the suite's
2JQS lineage is the reference), the explicit value's simple key
(`? k⏎: &p⏎…`), and ANY bare document after a `...` suffix (it refuses the
anchor-free `a: 1⏎...⏎b: 2` identically — `[210]`'s
`l-document-suffix+ l-any-document?` is the reference).

**Item 175 also STRUCK one of item 174's punt rows**: the flow-open ride
(`&p⏎[1, 2]`) was never on the fallback — `accum_flow_open_depth0`'s
`pendingProps` arm has ridden the run into the flow node (break or not,
`SFlowNode.propsContent` through the park's route) since items 9h/12, and
its only other branch serves under-run parks, which cannot exist at `n = 0`.

Recorded punts, each with the fallback still standing: the ENCLOSING-level
indented rides (`k:⏎  a: &p⏎    c: d`, `k:⏎  a: &p⏎  - w` — the ride pays
`n = 0` only), the two-park chain (`!t⏎&q b` and its break variants — one
`[96]` run whose internal separate crossed the break; the run-extension arm
is the NO-BREAK branch's, measured at item 175), the enclosing park's col-0
sibling `:` (`k:⏎  a: &p⏎: v` — a `[96]` park carries no mapping-lane
frames, item 173's recorded residue), and the alias landing (`&p⏎*p`,
scan-accepted and parser-refused).  The enclosing-level park's dedented
landing keeps `propsEmpty` + the sibling resume — the honest reading there
(`k:⏎  a: &p⏎c: 2`, `k:⏎  a: &p⏎  c: d`). -/

/-! ## §4  Finding A — the value at its own level's column (REFUSED, item 177)

The runtime floor, landed: the six §4 families items 171–176 pinned as
accepted readings now refuse at the scanner, with the slot-less twin's own
constructor at the run's start — mid-stream where a break ends the run, at
EOF where the stream does.  PyYAML refuses all but the block-scalar headers
(the named gap); no suite case decides any of them.  The `?`/`-`/`:` faces of
the same exemption (`?⏎b⏎: v`, `-⏎b`, `:⏎a`) and the mid-stream chain
(`k:⏎b⏎: 2`, which read as `{k: b, null: 2}`) refuse the same way. -/

/-! ## §5  Item 172 — §8.1's floor at the close

The deferred floor's own boundary map.  The KEY half: a same-line `:` after
the close resolves the collection as the awaiting entry's sibling key — at the
root, one level in, after an explicit entry, and as the awaited value's OWN
sibling (`k:⏎[1]: b` = `{k: null, [1]: b}`, the flow twin of §1's
`k:⏎a: 1`).  The anchor-shifted twin now differs from the bare form by its
anchor alone, in verdict and in events alike.  The VALUE half: an unresolved
slot-OFFERED landing refuses as `underIndentedFlowContent` at the OPEN's own
position (`underIndentedFlowValuePos?` reads the close's matching open,
`flowOpenIdx?`, and the open's column against the open levels — the
`[96]`-transparent slot holder decides offered-vs-completed, and the props
face `k:⏎&p [1, 2]` refuses at §4's own check as of item 178, at the `&p`
the run starts at), and a
break kills the key exactly
where §7.4's single-line rule says it dies.  The seq sibling refuses at the
resolving `:` (§8.2.1's key-at-sequence-column), the glued `:` at the
adjacent-value check (item 47), and the under-indented INTERIOR line at §8.1's
in-flow check — each the anchored twin's own verdict at the same mechanism. -/

| `bareNodeRoute_or_refused` at `h_op = true` (from `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`) | §1's sibling keys and open-sequence entries | same |
| `content_dispatch_after_close` | §1's siblings after an empty close (`k:⏎a: 1`) resume ALREADY (items 109/151 — the entry route threads `resumectx_of_landing` at all three callers, measured at item 174); ~~§4's scalar family (`k:⏎a`, its pendingMapValue caller)~~ **REFUSED at the scanner as of item 177**, so what the raw route itself still serves is §3b's rides | the sibling half is PAID; §4's half is REFUSED; ~~the props half~~ **PAID by item 174** (the ride context bypasses the route at the sentinel park) |

| `accum_content_pending`'s pendingProps landing (via `content_dispatch_after_close`) | §3b's rides — the sentinel run's break-crossed node (`&p⏎b`, `&p⏎b: 1`, `&p⏎|⏎  x`) read as propsEmpty + a bare second document | **PAID by item 174**: `PropsRideRoute` carries the park's route + run, `content_dispatch_routed` assembles `[161]`/`[198]`/`[196]`'s props slots, and the enclosing-level park (`0 < n`) keeps propsEmpty + resume; residues = the indented-enclosing/two-park/alias punts pinned in §3b |
| `accum_block_pending`'s pendingProps landing (via `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`) | §3b's indicator rides — the sentinel run's break-crossed `-`/`?`/`:` (`&p⏎- a`, `&p⏎? x⏎: v`, `&p⏎: v`) read as propsEmpty + a bare second document | **PAID by item 175**: `PropsNodeRoute` (the ride's landing half) rides the same park route into `[196]`'s slot — `propsSeqRoute` at the `-` arm's entries, `propsMapRoute(F)` as the openers' fifth cascade arm; the flow-open twin was paid on the FLOW lane at items 9h/12 (174's punt row for it struck at 175), and the enclosing-level park (`0 < n`) keeps propsEmpty + resume |
| `topLevelFlowResumeSep_or_refused` fallbacks, `flowKeyRoute_of_root` landing arm | §2's sibling flow keys (item 172's key half) | the key half **RESUMES as of item 176** (`h_mapF` at the landing arm, `resumeMapRoute` first in the cascade, paid by `pendingContent.h_framesS`/`pendingBlockContent.h_closeF`; the entries-level twin rides every arm, so the chains resume too); the value half is refused at the gate and the refuted arms cover it; what still reaches the fallback is a landing whose park pays no face (the marker-seed chain at `flowKeyRoute_of_open`'s twins, the seq-spaces sibling, §2's recorded punts) |
| ~~`flowKeyRoute_of_root` no-break arm~~ | the seed key (`[1]: b`) | **PAID by item 173**: the no-break arm's premise carries the virgin park's own `h_nodoc` face beside the column, so `nodocMapRoute` is the arm's only route and the raw `rootMapRoute` application is deleted — the census's `rootMapRoute` holder is gone |
