/-! # `- &p a: 1` — the property run as a key head at every frame (DOCS item 41)

A `[96] c-ns-properties` run is not a node, so the accumulator PARKS it
(`pendingProps`) and finishes the value one step later.  Item 17 also made the
parked run a KEY head — `&p a` is `[161]`'s `propsContent` arm read at
`block-key`, which is `[188] ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`'s `[194]` alternative —
but it wrote what the finished entry does with itself as the run's own
COORDINATES: a column-0 line start, the stream closed there, `[63] s-indent(k)`
in between.  That triple is `rootMapRoute`'s argument list, so the only producer
it ever admitted was the root one, and `- &p a: 1` deferred.

Item 41 is item 38 applied to the sibling pack.  `PropsKeyPack` now carries the
CONCLUSION those coordinates were only one way to reach —
`∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry k sp_p sp_v → SLYamlStream sp_start sp_v` — and
`entryPropsKeyPack_of_dispatch` is `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch` with the run in the
key head's place, merged over the landing disjunct exactly as item 40 merged the
scalar pack's two producers.  The consumer got shorter by the one `rootMapRoute`
application it used to make.

What the four call sites gain is the INTERSECTION of two independent
restrictions — which landing branch the caller's input analysis can see, and
which frame the pending it parks can close (Reflection 667):

| parked at                        | branches seen | frames offered  | served  |
| :------------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :------ |
| `-` / root, index 0              | line + break  | compact + node  | both    |
| `-`, indented                    | line only     | compact + node  | compact |
| `[189]` value, index 0           | line + break  | node only       | break   |
| `[189]` value, indented          | line only     | node only       | none    |

§1 the family at each frame.  §2 composing.  §3 the two halves of the pack that
did NOT move.  §4 what still punts — including the fourth row above — and the
boundary the scanner keeps.

/-! ## §1  The run heads a key at each of the entry's frames

Three frames, one reading of the characters.  On the `-`'s own line the entry is
`[185] s-l+block-indented`'s `s-indent(m) ns-l-compact-mapping(n+1+m)`, closing
the enclosing entry (`compactMapRoute`).  Across a break to column 0 it belongs
to a mapping nested inside the node the pending awaits — `[185]`'s block-node
alternative under a `-`, `[189]`'s value slot under a `k:` — and `[199]
s-l+block-collection` spends the landing as its own leading comments
(`valueMapRoute`).  The key HEAD is the same in all three: `[194]`'s
`c-flow-json-node` at `block-key`, whose props slot the run fills. -/

/-! ## §3  The two halves of the pack that did NOT move

Only the route changed.  The run's `block-key` re-read is item 17's — `[96]`'s
context occurs inside its optional second half alone, so a single-half run reads
anywhere (`PropsRun.toPropertiesBlockKey`) and a two-half one only when its
internal separation stayed on the line, which is what the extension arm builds
it from.  And the §7.4 datum is item 17's too: the key the `:` will resolve was
saved AT the property, so `&p a: 1` records its key one column left of where
`a: 1` does, and the root reading is unchanged. -/

/-! ## §4  What still punts, and the boundary the scanner keeps

The fourth row of this file's table is the site that gains nothing, and it is
empty for two reasons at once: the arm sees the break-free branch only, and a
`[189]` VALUE slot is `s-l+block-node`, which has no compact alternative to
close.  Neither restriction is a boundary alone — `k:⏎  &p a: 1` above is the
same pending's break-crossed reading, and `  - &p a: 1` above is the same
branch's compact one — which is what makes the intersection worth computing
before writing the call (Reflection 667).

Below that: a closed FLOW node parks through the flow machinery, so its `:` is
`FlowOpenStack`'s business; a block-scalar header is a node and never a key; and
what the scanner refuses it refuses before any of this is asked. -/
