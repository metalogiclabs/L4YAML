# How wide the park's gap is, in scanner steps (DOCS item 244)

Item 243 measured the gap `sp_block → sp_scan` at the ELEVEN sites that spend
`SLYamlStream.scannerDrop` and found nothing spanning it: no correspondence at
the block position, no equation, and the only hypothesis naming both endpoints
is the `PendingNode` item 239 refuted.  Its recorded NEXT asked **how many
scanner steps the gap is wide**, and warned that the park might absorb a RUN
rather than a step — in which case the obligation is an induction and a census
counting step equations would under-price it.

## The question has to be asked one level down

Those eleven sites are the park's CONSUMERS, and a consumer holds no scanner
state of its own: `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` receives the park and spends the
escape in its `pendingFlow` branch.  `pendingFlow`'s fields are
`h_stream : SLYamlStream sp_start sp_block` and three facts about `sc` and
`sp_scan.col`; **no field of it names both `sp_block` and `sp_scan`.**  The gap
is therefore fixed where the park is BUILT, by `block_dispatch_deferred` — which
binds `sp_X` free under a stream and pins `sp_scan'` with a correspondence, and
relates the two nowhere.  So §2 reads the producer's own application sites: the
four heads (the producer and its three class wrappers) at **twelve** sites
across **seven** declarations.

## The answer: one step, at six of the nine that have a scanner in scope

| class | sites | width | the step |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_stamp_offcol` / `_stamp_nopack` | 6 | **1** | `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators` |
| `block_dispatch_deferred` at `accum_content_pending` | 1 | **2** | `…_preprocess` then `…_dispatchContent` |
| `_inline` | 2 | unreached | — |
| the three wrapper bodies | 3 | unreached | nothing in scope |

`corrBlock=0` at all twelve, exactly as item 243 read at the consumers: the
gap's left endpoint carries no scanner state anywhere in the library.  What the
six DO hold is a grammar path from `sp_X` to the dispatch's input position, so
the gap factors and the unpaid factor is one step.

**The width is a measurement of what is IN SCOPE, so the production edges must
be the ones a site HOLDS.**  Counting edges inside an implication's antecedent
reads `accum_content_pending` at width 1 instead of 2 — the site would be
crossing its own gap with the obligation being priced.  `posEdges` descends into
a hypothesis's conclusion and never into its premises, and that restriction is
what moves the one reading.

## The two censuses meet at one step, and the meeting point is empty

Item 242 measured how often the library carries a grammar production across a
scanner step: once, in 294 dispatch holders.  §3 re-derives that ladder for the
three functions these sites actually cross, in THIS module's import closure:

| function | holders | edge | chain |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators` | 97 | **0** | **0** |
| `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` | 129 | 2 | 1 |
| `scanNextToken_preprocess` | 186 | 17 | 6 |

A holder count moves with what is imported and the crossings do not: the last
two agree with item 242's own pins, taken one module earlier.

**The six sites whose gap is one step cross the one function with no precedent
at all.**  Not one of its holders carries a production landing on its output,
let alone a path to it.  The function with a worked crossing is at the site
whose gap is two.

## What the one step actually is: one character

§1 proves it rather than counting it, which is what answers the mandate's RUN
warning.  Every arm of `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators` —
`scanBlockEntry`, `scanKey`, `scanValue` — ends in exactly one
`ScannerState.advance`, and none of the emits, indent pushes or key clearings
in front of it touches the four fields `ScannerSurfCorr` reads.  So the step
consumes ONE character, and under the sites' own non-break indicator the
production owed across it is a single `GLit` — `[184] c-l-block-seq-entry`,
`[190] c-l-block-map-explicit-key` or `[6] c-mapping-value`, the three rules
the scanner function already carries as spec annotations.

**The park does not absorb a run.**  The obligation at six of the twelve is one
literal character, not an induction over a flow collection.
