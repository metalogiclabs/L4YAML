# β.5's other half, and what a closure over-prices (DOCS item 263)

Row 12 names β.5 *"retire `pendingFlow`, delete `scannerDrop`"* — **two**
deletions.  Every instrument in this row measured the second one.  Item 238
walked `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop`'s dependents and read `D=4 S=0 R=0 T=26`, and
twenty-six less the two restatements is the "twenty-four reproofs" the plan has
carried since.  `PendingNode.pendingFlow`'s own dependents have never been
walked, so the bill names one of β.5's two halves.

This file walks the other one, over the same environment pass and with the same
populations, and then does what the arm's census could not do for itself: it
says how much of its own answer is a CEILING.

## The ceiling, restated for the park

Item 238's rule holds here too.  **A consumer depends on its supplier's TYPE,
not on its proof.**  So of the park's populations only `Sp` — the declarations
whose STATEMENT names the constructor — can force work above them.  `Dp` breaks
in its own proofs and stops there, and `Tp` prices a rebuild rather than a
rewrite.  `Tp` is reported because a closure is what the plan has been quoting,
and the honest way to retire that habit is to print the number beside the one
that replaces it.

## What the flip is for, and why it is not optional here

`scripts/flip_beta5.py` applies β.5's actual edit — both deletions and
`dropClose` with them — and then drives the build to a FIXPOINT: it replaces
each broken declaration's proof with `sorry`, neutralizes each top-level census
whose pins the deletion re-reads, and rebuilds until the tree is clean.  That
is what reads the truth.  Every flip before it printed

    LOWER BOUND — the build stopped at the first failing module

and both construction sites live in a module the library root imports, so until
that gate ran, not one of the twenty-four had ever been elaborated against a
post-β.5 tree.  The two instruments bracket each other exactly as item 240's
pair did:

    walk (a rebuild's price)   ⊇   truth (the fixpoint)   ⊇   any flip that stops

and §2 pins the bracket, so a refinement that moves one end without the other
disagrees loudly.

    WITH the constructor, and `accum_structural_pending` splits on the

    what makes this one a reading rather than a limit of the closure. -/

/-! ## §2 The bracket, and the three numbers it separates

`Tp=31` against `T=26`: **twelve declarations β.5 reaches that the arm's
closure never counted** — `PendingNode.arm_or_col` and the three park lemmas
above, the four `accum_block_on_*` and the four `block_dispatch_deferred*`.
Nineteen of item 238's twenty-six are shared.  So the bill stated as a closure
is **thirty-eight**, not twenty-six, and it was never twenty-six because it was
only ever half of β.5.

**And thirty-eight is not what β.5 costs.**  The fixpoint elaborates the whole
tree against the post-β.5 sources and reads

    sorried=13  restated=0  deleted=3  pins=36

— thirteen proofs, of which seven are the library's (all in `StreamAccum.lean`)
and six are Tests-side; ONE statement, `dropClose`, which goes with the arm;
and not one statement anywhere that must change, which is `Sp=0` read a second
way and over the whole tree rather than over this file's closure.

The three numbers are three different questions and only the last is the bill:

| reading | what it counts | value |
|---|---|---|
| `Tp ∪ T` | what a REBUILD touches | **38** |
| `Dp` (+ item 238's `D`) | what NAMES a deletion | 9 + 4 |
| the fixpoint | what stops ELABORATING | **13 proofs + 1 statement** |

**The closure over-prices by a factor of three**, and every flip before the
fixpoint under-priced by stopping at the first failing module.  That is why
both instruments are kept: neither one alone is the number.

## What this file's closure is, and what it is not

Two hundred and thirty-four modules — item 238's 233 and this file.
`DropFalsity`, `ParkGapCensus` and the rest of the guard tree are outside it,
so `Dp` is a reading of the library plus the two Tests modules that hold the
arm's first ring, exactly as item 238's census was.  **The whole-tree reading
is the fixpoint's**, and the two agree where they overlap: the walk's nine
contains the fixpoint's seven, and the two it adds are named above.
-/

/-- The fixpoint's own reading.  Nothing in Lean can re-derive it — it is a
    property of a source tree that does not exist — so the pin is checked from
    the other side: `scripts/flip_beta5.py` reads this literal out of this file
    and compares its own summary line against it, printing `FIX-PIN agrees`.  A
    pin checked against itself is an empty check (§9). -/
def expectedFixpoint : String :=
  "rounds=23 clean=1 sorried=13 restated=0 deleted=3 refused=0 pins=37 waves=[7,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] gone=1 carried=21 free=4"

/-- **The same edit with the DEAD BRANCHES deleted rather than sorried**
    (item 264).  The fixpoint above keeps every broken statement and loses only
    its proof, so it can say a proof breaks and never say what repairing it
    costs.  `scripts/beta5_arms.py` makes β.5's deletions and then deletes the
    five dead `| pendingFlow` arms for real, and reads the residue:

    * `control` re-derives the seven in the same run, so `dead` is a delta of
      this run rather than of item 263's;
    * `dead=5` — five of the seven were a case arm and nothing else, and one of
      the five (`accum_content_pending`'s) carried an application of the escape
      with it, so a class of `block_dispatch_deferred`'s domain empties with the
      constructor;
    * what is LEFT is two errors of one line each.  `accum_flow_open_depth0`
      keeps `have drop_ride`, where `dropClose` is spent and which three LIVE
      arms take (`ScannerFlowOpenUnderRun` §4 prices it), and
      `block_dispatch_deferred` is the escape, whose body IS the constructor.

    Checked from the other side, like `expectedFixpoint`: the script reads this
    literal and prints `ARM-PIN agrees`. -/

/-! ## §4 What this file does NOT establish

It prices a REBUILD.  Whether any of the declarations it counts can be reproved
with its statement intact is a proof question, and `Tp` has nothing to say about
it — that is the same boundary item 238 drew around its twenty-six and item 237
around its fifteen.  The fixpoint does not decide it either: a declaration whose
proof was replaced by `sorry` may be FALSE in the post-β.5 model, which item 239
proved for `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` after item 238's graph had called it
reprovable.  Both instruments price the BUILD. -/


/-! ## §5 Who HOLDS the gates the under-run dies at (DOCS item 268)

§2's fixpoint prices the rebuild; this prices a REACH.  Item 267 built the
carrier that fires the two gates a depth-0 flow open's under-run dies at, and
the question its wiring turns on is which declaration holds the hypothesis the
firing contradicts.

There are four checks — §8.1's floor and §9.2's dangling run, each with a
mid-stream and an end-of-input twin — and `ScannerFlowOpenUnderRun` §8 reads the
same ninety/fifty-four partition of the 144 at every one of them.  This is the
proof-side half: for each check, the constants of the ACCUMULATION whose TYPE
mentions it, which is what it means to hold the check's success as a premise.

The count is taken in the environment and not over the text.  A grep sees the
name; it does not see whether the mention is a binder of the statement or a step
of the proof, and those are the two halves this census has to separate: a check
whose success is derived inside a proof and spent on the next line reads, to a
grep of that file, exactly like a binder of the statement.

**The reading.**  §9.2 is held twenty-one times mid-stream and five at the end
of input; §8.1 sixteen and four.  The two run together: every accumulation
declaration that holds §9.2's success in order to read a park's FACE holds
§8.1's beside it, and both faces reach the close as premises of
`pendingContent`'s `h_closable` (item 275).

**What the gap is.**  Six declarations hold §9.2's mid-stream check and not
§8.1's, and two hold §9.2's end-of-input check and not §8.1's; one holds each
of §8.1's and neither of §9.2's, which is what makes the columns 21/16 and 5/4
rather than 21/15 and 5/3.  Those last two are the bridges that read a silence
off a success — `underIndented_none_of_check` and `underIndented_none_of_eof`,
whose §9.2 twins `dangling_none_of_check` and `dangling_none_of_eof` account
for one of the six and one of the two.  The rest is the REFUTATION family:
`propsPark_open_gate`, `propsPark_stale_dangling`, `propsPark_dangling_of_body`
and `propsPark_dangling_of_prop` mid-stream with `danglingPark_refutes_landing`
beside them, and `danglingPark_refutes_eof` at the end of input.  Each reads the
dangling run in order to REFUTE a landing, and §8.1's floor has no twin for
that use, so the gap is a difference in what the two verdicts are FOR rather
than a rail left unbuilt.

**And these counts are this theorem's, not the environment's**: the same four
names are held in the emitter-scannability chain too, §8.1's two checks eleven
and fifteen times there.  A census that reported only the first four numbers
could not tell a check nothing holds from a check nothing mentions, and §9 is
that an empty check is not a check. -/
