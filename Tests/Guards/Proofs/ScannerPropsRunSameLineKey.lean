/-! # The property run's park hands the stamp on (DOCS item 102)

Item 101 refuted the `[189]` implicit value's frameless key at the value's own
content park (`k: a: 1`).  Its props twin measured the same refusal and kept
deferring: `entryPropsKeyPack_of_dispatch` returned `PropsKeyPack ∨ True`, so a
run parked in that same value slot had no reason to name.

What stood in the way was the CARRIER, not the reasoning.  `KeyPackPunt`'s two
refutable reasons carried `StaleNodeTail`, whose fourth conjunct says the last
real token COMPLETES a value — and `[96] c-ns-properties` tokens are excluded
from `completesFlowValue` by construction, so no property park has one (§4a
below pins that).  The refutations read three of the four conjuncts.  Typed as
what they read (`StalePark`), the same two reasons serve a value park and a
property park alike, and every one of the props producer's punt branches gets
a name.

The reason then has to TRAVEL, because a run parks before its content:
`k: &p a: 1`'s `:` meets the park the *scalar* made, two steps after the value
indicator that stamped the line.  `keyPackPunt_transport` is that step, and it
is used at both moves — the run's own EXTENSION (`&p !t`) and the run's
CONTENT — which is why `k: !t &p a: 1` is refused wherever `k: a: 1` is. -/
