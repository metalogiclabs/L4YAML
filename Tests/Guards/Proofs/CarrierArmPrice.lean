# What `BlockStack`'s missing arm costs, and whether it is honest (DOCS item 246)

Item 245 found that the park's literal has nowhere to land: `BlockStack` has one
reflexive constructor against `SeqFrame`'s ten, so the library cannot state an
open block entry, and what the six one-step sites owe is a block node rather
than a character.  Its recorded NEXT named the number nothing held — **what
`BlockStack`'s missing constructor would close** — and warned that an arm
relating two positions its premises do not connect is `scannerDrop` under
another name.  So the first question here is the arm's honesty and only the
second is its price.

**§0 is the arm**, defined here as `BlockStackOpen` so nothing in the library
moves: `SBlockSeqEntries.single`'s first two premises, held the way
`SeqFrame.midQuestion` holds its indicator — at the END of the frame, the
mandatory separator belonging to the next step.  `n` is bound by the arm and
not by the index, so no statement naming `BlockStack sp sp'` would change.

**§1 grades every arm in the library by connectivity**, and the candidate by
the same code.  Item 236's census (`SuffixGapAudit.lean`) read the surface
grammar's 167 arms for a directed chain of production edges from the
conclusion's source to its target and found `scannerDrop` alone broken.  The
proof layer's parks and stacks were outside it, and they carry CLOSURES — a
content park says "if comments run from `sp_scan` to `sp_mid` then the stream
reaches `sp_mid`" and names its block position nowhere else — so a two-way
reading would misgrade them.  Three grades, each strictly weaker than the last:

- `direct` — item 236's reading, with a closure's own hypotheses and body read
  under its telescope: a directed chain of production, parameter or literal
  edges from the production's source (its last-but-one position) to its
  target (its last);
- `anchored` — undirected, every premise linking every position it mentions,
  closures included, and the target linked to SOME position the conclusion
  names other than itself;
- `broken` — not even anchored: the target is held by nothing the arm states.

`broken` is the escape class.  The candidate must read `direct`, the class of
`SeqFrame.midQuestion`, or the flip below prices a repair for a second hole.

**§2 is the carrier's readers, environment-resolved.**  A flip counts what
stops elaborating, and the build stops at the first failing module, so its
count is a lower bound taken inside `StreamAccum` alone.  The environment can
give the whole first wave — every constant whose value reaches a `BlockStack`
eliminator — library and guards together, and beside it the constants that
merely MENTION the carrier (the invariant's conjunct) and those that BUILD its
`nil`, neither of which an added arm touches.

**§3 is the second wave.**  The readers are the two absorptions, and with the
arm both are FALSE as stated — a stream cannot absorb an open entry — so their
repair is a restatement, and a restatement's price is its readers.

**§4 is what the arm closes.**  `entry_open_of_park_span` spends the six
sites' own path and item 244's literal into the candidate carrier with no
unpaid premise, against item 245's `seq_entry_of_park_span`, which needed a
whole block node to land the same literal in the grammar.

`scripts/flip_carrier.py` runs the flip for real — `arm` adds the constructor,
`retire` adds it and deletes both absorptions — restores the source, and checks
its `StreamAccum` counts against the lists pinned here.

/-- `BlockStack` with the arm the flip inserts, under another name so the
    library is untouched.  `seqEntryOpen` is `[183]`'s entry with its content
    still owed: the indentation and the `-`, the indicator at the frame's end
    exactly as `SeqFrame.midQuestion` holds its `?`. -/

/-! ## §4 What the arm closes -/

/-- **The park's literal lands, and nothing is owed.**  The same two facts item
    245's `seq_entry_of_park_span` spent — the sites' `SIndent` path and item
    244's `dispatchBI_span_glit` — are the candidate arm's two premises, and
    the arm's target is where the scanner's cursor stands.  Item 245's lemma
    needed `GNot SNsChar` and a whole `SBlockIndented` beyond this point; this
    one needs nothing beyond it, because a carrier holds an entry OPEN where a
    production can only hold one closed. -/
