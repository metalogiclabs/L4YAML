/-! # A landed key inside a `?` frame still owes the frame's value line (DOCS item 106)

`[186] c-l-block-map-explicit-key(n)`'s KEY is `s-l+block-indented(n,
block-out)`, and that production has TWO alternatives.  Items 92–96 paid the
frame's value line at the COMPACT one — `s-indent(m)` plus a compact
collection, so the key shares the `?`'s line (`? a: b⏎: - w`, `? - a⏎: - w`).
The other alternative is `[199] s-l+block-collection`: the key LANDS on a line
of its own, more indented than the `?` (`?⏎  a: b⏎: - w`).

Items 93 and 94 read that landing as frameless — "no compact alternative, so
no frame twins it" — and the first half is right for the wrong level.  The
SLOT has no compact alternative and never will; the FRAME is one level up, and
it is unchanged by which alternative its key took.  So the landed branch owes
exactly what the compact branch owes: `s-indent(n) ':'` and the value slot
(`[197] l-block-map-explicit-value(n)`), after which the `[188]` entry is
finished.

The route is the one the branch already builds.  `valueMapRoute` sends the
landed entry through `nestedBlockMap` into the node the pending awaits; the
twin sends the same `nestedBlockMap` into the frame's value line instead
(`explFrameValueLine`, derived once from the park's own `h_expl`).

Everything pinned below is RUNTIME behavior and none of it changed at this
item — no runtime file is touched.  The pins say what the proof's new payment
has to be consistent with; an escape is silent, so no runtime observation can
say which arm a given input takes. -/

/-! ## §6 The payment at its type

The twin is a derivation from the park's own explicit frame: fold the awaited
KEY node into `[186]`'s key slot, take `s-indent(n) ':'` and the value, hand
the finished `[188]` entry to the route the `?` producer already pays.  The
`Or.inr` argument is the park's own `h_kslot`, for a park whose frame is a
level up — so the two funders are one datum. -/
