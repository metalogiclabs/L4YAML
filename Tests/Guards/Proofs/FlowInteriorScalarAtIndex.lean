/-! # A flow-interior scalar's floor is the ENCLOSING block indent (DOCS item 67a)

Item 45 lifted a scalar token's reading at 0 to every index and returned the
MULTI-LINE ones as `*Crossed` witnesses, which item 46's collapse then rode.
Item 67a builds those readings at the flow stack's own index instead, and the
whole arithmetic rests on one runtime fact, pinned here: **a flow scalar's
continuation lines are measured against the enclosing BLOCK indent, not
against the scalar's own start column.**

* §1 the floor is exact, and it is `currentIndent`.  A `-` at column 2 puts
  the sequence's indent at 2, so the flow node inside it reads at 3 — and a
  continuation line clears `s-indent(3)` at column 3 and no earlier, however
  far right the scalar itself started.  All three scalar styles measure the
  same way, which is why one loop lemma serves them.
* §2 **and §6.1's own gate covers the tab**, at every column at or left of the
  floor: `s-indent(n)` is spaces, so a tab there is not indentation.  Past the
  floor it is `[66] s-separate-in-line`'s `s-white` and reads fine.
* §3 the ROOT is where the two coincide and the arithmetic is vacuous: with no
  enclosing block collection the index is 0, `s-indent(0)` asks for nothing,
  and the tab is a leading white.

ZERO runtime edits: every pin below behaved this way before item 67a too. -/
