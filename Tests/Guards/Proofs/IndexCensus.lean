/-! # The census over INDICES (DOCS item 203)

Item 202 left one row — `flowKeyRoute_of_open`'s value-line resume, the only
conclusion conjunct in `StreamAccum` that no arm pays and no relay hides — and
priced its payment as *carrying item 196's CHAIN into the resume twins*, with
one instruction attached:

> Measure whether the CONSUMERS can spend a list before widening the producers;
> that is the direction item 189–192 went and it cost four items.

This is that measurement.  A widening pays only where something READS the wider
shape, so the question is not how many declarations state the field — it is
whether anything tests the index the field names.  For every `∃ x : Nat` and
`∃ x : List Nat` binder in the module's surface whose body states a
`ResumeFrames`, this census counts how many times that binder occurs in its own
body.  **An index that occurs ONCE is write-only**: nothing else in the field
mentions it, so nothing downstream can be testing it, and a list in its place
would name members no consumer could ask about.

## What it reads

The three resume lanes are separated by the bottom their frames stand on.  On
the STREAM lane and the SEQUENCE lane the list `ks` is read — `resumectx_of_landing`
decides `w ∈ ks` and the covers quantify over it.  On the VALUE-LINE lane the
frames list is read the same way **and the bottom's own index is not**: every
one of the `nv` binders occurs exactly once, as `ExplValueLine`'s argument and
nowhere else.

That is the measurement item 202 asked for, and it answers NO: the consumers
cannot spend a list on this lane, because they do not spend the index.

## The surface, and the control on it

The census reads each constant's TYPE, plus the VALUE of a constant whose type
is a DEFINITION rather than a theorem.  Three carriers state the field in their
bodies and in no binder of any type (`ImplicitKeyPack`, `PropsKeyPack`,
`ResumeKeyCtx`), which is item 196's own recorded
gotcha (*a local `have` can carry a copy of a widened type with no binder to
grep for*) in its definitional form.  `surfaceControl` below is the list a
TYPE-ONLY census would miss, pinned — so the cruder instrument's blind spot has
to move a number here before it can hide one there.

`unclassified` is this census's `un=` column, in item 202's sense: a
`ResumeFrames` binder whose bottom is none of the three known lanes.  It is
empty, and a fourth bottom would have to announce itself rather than be
silently dropped. -/
