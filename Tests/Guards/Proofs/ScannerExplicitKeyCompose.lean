/-! # The explicit `?` key composes (DOCS item 20)

Item 13 gave the col-0 `:` its arm — `[189]`'s EMPTY-key entry — and parked
`PendingNode.pendingMapValue`, whose closure names only the node it awaits and
never the indicator that opened it.  Item 20 spends that: `?` is `[188]`'s
OTHER alternative, so a second producer (`question_open_map`) reuses the same
pending, the same consumers and the same dispatch arm — `indicator_open_map`
takes `:` and `?` in ONE branch — and the entry it composes is
`[186] c-l-block-map-explicit-entry` with its `e-node` value.

That `e-node` value alternative had to be ADDED to the surface grammar
(`SBlockMapEntry.explicitEmpty`): `SBlockMapEntry.explicit` demanded the `:`
line, so every key-only entry below parsed correctly with no derivation at all.
The whole cost of the arm was that constructor.

Nothing here is new BEHAVIOUR: item 20 edits no runtime file, and these pins
are the shapes whose accumulation changed, held fixed so a later runtime change
cannot move them silently.  What is still punted is the indented `?` (`- ? a`,
whites before the indicator) — the indent machinery's arm, accepted through the
deferral, pinned in §3.

The shape with NO `:` line is the one that had no derivation.  Its value is
the zero-width `e-node`, so the entry ends exactly where its key does. -/

A following `?` closes this entry and opens the next as a bare-document
continuation — `[211]`'s over-approximation, the same route `: a⏎: b` takes. -/

/-! ## §3  Still punted — the indent machinery's `?`

A `?` inside an entry sits at column 2, so it is the indented arm, not this
one.  It accepts through the deferral, unchanged. -/

#guard emits "- ? a\n"

   "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §4  The neighbours — must NOT move, identical in BOTH pipelines

`?x` is not an indicator at all (`isKeyCandidate` wants a blank after it), and
the two refusals below are the scanner's and the parser's, unchanged. -/

#guard emits "?x\n" ["+STR", "+DOC", "=VAL :?x", "-DOC", "-STR"]
-- §6.1: a tab right after the block `?` would be the key's indentation.
#guard verdicts "?\ta\n" ==
  (some (.tabInIndentation 0 1), some (.tabInIndentation 0 1))
-- A mapping and a sequence cannot share one bare document.
#guard verdicts "? a\n- b\n" ==
  (some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0), some (.invalidBareDocument 1 0))
