# The spend census: who can READ the conjunct (item 224)

Item 222 built the STRENGTH LADDER, a census of PRODUCERS.  Item 223 built the
DEMAND LEDGER, a census of PARAMETERS, and closed its own record with the debt
this file pays:

> the demand ledger is a signature census, not a spend census — it counts which
> consumers ASK for the weak form, and nothing counts how many of the eight
> would actually USE the conjunct if they had it, so a loose parameter that no
> proof would read is indistinguishable here from one that is throwing strength
> away.

The two are not the same question and they do not have the same answer.  A
consumer that asks loose is **throwing strength away** only if its proof could
spend the strength; if it could not, the loose parameter is the RIGHT type and
the ledger row is not a debt at all.  Distinguishing them needs an instrument
that reads proofs rather than signatures, and there are two here.

## The instrument, part one: the arm binder resolved by TYPE

Item 223's ledger was assembled by grepping the loose literal and listing the
tight side by hand.  §1 below reads both off the ELABORATED types instead, by
matching the arm's exact shape — `ska = true ∨ R` and
`(ska = true ∧ poss = false) ∨ R`.  It finds **22** binders where the ledger
recorded twelve consumers.  The eight LOOSE ones are item 223's eight exactly;
the tight side is not four but fourteen, of which six are the park constructors
(the supply, correctly outside a demand census) and **four are consumers the
ledger never listed**: `block_dispatch_deferred` and its three stamp siblings.

## The instrument, part two: the WEAKENING PROBE

A flip patch tightens a binder and counts what breaks.  Its dual LOOSENS one
that is already tight and counts who screams, and that is the spend census: an
error inside the weakened lemma's own proof is a READ, and an error at a call
site is PLUMBING.  Run one binder at a time — eight builds, so that two
weakened lemmas which feed each other cannot mask one another — it reads:

| tight consumer | self-errors | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `block_dispatch_deferred` | 1 | CONDUIT → `PendingNode.pendingFlow`'s field |
| `block_dispatch_deferred_stamp_offcol` | 1 | CONDUIT → `block_dispatch_deferred` |
| `block_dispatch_deferred_stamp_nopack` | 1 | CONDUIT → `block_dispatch_deferred` |
| `block_dispatch_deferred_inline` | 1 | CONDUIT → `block_dispatch_deferred` |
| `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock` | 2 | PLUMBING — a stale `Or.imp_left` and its `refine` |
| `colon_fires_implicit_key` | 2 | **READ** — `⟨_, h_poss_f⟩` refutes the branch |
| `accum_block_on_pendingContent` | 3 | CONDUIT → the two above |
| `accum_block_on_pendingBlockContent` | 2 | CONDUIT + one stale projection |

**One reader.**  Of the eight tight consumers exactly one destructures the
conjunct, twice, and both times to kill a branch outright — and it takes
`⟨_, h_poss_f⟩`, discarding the FLAG.  The landings are its mirror: they read
the flag and can never read the conjunct.  The arm is not one datum every
consumer shares, it is a PAIR whose two halves have disjoint readers.

## What that says about the eight loose rows

They are not a debt.  Nothing behind a landing reads the conjunct — the one
reader takes its arm from a park constructor's field through two relays
(§2's `FIELD`/`RELAY` edges), never through a landing, whose conclusions are
about the LANDED state.  And §4 shows the tight form of each landing is a
one-line corollary of the loose one, available at any call site that ever wants
it, at no cost to the library.  **The ledger counted corollaries as debt.**

The rule this item adds: **a demand row is a debt only if the consumer can
spend it; a census of who ASKS for strength is not a census of who READS it,
and to price a tightening you loosen what is already tight and count who
screams.**  Its corollary, which is the reason the two are not interchangeable:
**tightening a consumer that cannot read the conjunct buys only plumbing, and
plumbing is one `imp_left` away in either direction.**

## The projection count, re-measured

Item 223's record says `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock` "projects it away FOUR
TIMES" to reach the landings.  Resolved by the elaborator there are **nine**
`Or.imp_left` relays into the two landings, four at `closeThenBlock` and five
at `accum_block_on_pendingBlockContent` — the count was taken at one caller and
carried as if it were the total.  §2 pins all eighty-five arm payment edges so
it cannot be taken at one caller again.

/-! ## §2  The one read, and the refutation that the loose arm cannot state

`colon_fires_implicit_key` spends the conjunct twice, at the two places its
pack's guard meets a park that preprocessing did not re-save.  Both are the
same three lines, and this is them: the conjunct says the park carried no
save, the branch supposes it carried one, so the branch is dead. -/

    (h_arm : (sc.simpleKeyAllowed = true ∧ sc.simpleKey.possible = false) ∨

  rcases h_arm with ⟨_, h_poss_f⟩ | h_colpos
  · exact absurd h_poss (by rw [h_poss_f]; exact Bool.false_ne_true)
  · omega

/-- **And the loose arm provably cannot.**  This is what makes the weakening
    probe's error a fact about the ARM rather than about the proof that broke:
    there is a state with the flag UP and a save PENDING at column 0, so the
    loose reading leaves the branch alive.  The witness is built, not asserted. -/

/-! ## §3  Why the landings can never read it

The landings' left branch routes through `saveSimpleKey`, and outside a flow
`saveSimpleKey` branches on `simpleKeyAllowed` alone: armed, it OVERWRITES the
save without consulting the one it replaces.  So two states differing only in
`simpleKey` leave it agreeing, and no conclusion downstream of an armed save
can depend on the conjunct.  That is the spend census's answer for the two
consumers the plan named, and it is a fact about the FUNCTION, not about the
proof that happens to sit above it. -/

/-! ## §4  The eight loose rows are corollaries, not debt

If a caller ever holds the tight arm and wants a landing, it does not need the
landing tightened: the tight statement follows from the loose lemma by one
`imp_left`, here, once, for every caller there will ever be.  Nothing in the
library changes and no cascade is paid.  These two are the rows item 223's
NEXT called "the cheapest next reading"; they are cheaper still unbought. -/

/-! ## §5  The family reading has no library reader

Item 223 put `PendingNode.arm_tight_or_col` in the library and reduced item
78's nine-arm `arm_or_col` to one `And.left` off it.  That `And.left` is its
only library call site: the tight family reading is projected back to loose one
line after it is stated, and every other use of it is in a guard module.  The
one reader of the conjunct does not go through it at all — §1's `FIELD=6` is
the route, a park constructor's own field taken by `casesOn` inside
`accum_block_pending` and relayed twice.

That is not an argument for deleting it.  It is the measurement item 223's
pricing could not make, because the ladder counts what a carrier CAN state and
nothing counted whether anything downstream reads what it states. -/

example {sc : ScannerState} {sp_start sp_block sp_scan : SurfPos}
