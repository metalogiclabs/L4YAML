/-! # The indented entry's PROPERTY RUN composes (DOCS item 24)

Item 23 gave the indented entry's inline value a reading at the entry's own
index, and named four ways for that reading to be unavailable.  The first was
not about the reading at all: `&`/`!` do not complete a value, they open a
`[96] c-ns-properties` run that item 12 PARKS, and `PendingNode.pendingProps`
routed the eventually-decorated node through a closure typed at
`SBlockNode 0 .blockIn`.  So the obstruction was in the pending, one step
before the content — `  - &a v` deferred even though `  - v` composed.

Re-indexing the route is the whole of item 24, and it needs no lift: a FRESH
run is single-half (`PropsRun.anchor` / `.tag`), and `PropsRun`'s only
occurrence of the index is the `s-separate(n,c)` inside `[96]`'s optional
SECOND half.  A one-half run therefore reads at every index by construction —
Reflection 649's rule with the strongest possible answer, no occurrence at
all — and the two-half extension (`&a !t v`) builds its internal separator
from the preprocessing's residual whites, which are `[66] s-separate-in-line`
and read at every index too.  What the value then needs is `[156]
ns-flow-content` rather than `[161] ns-flow-node`, because `[161]`'s
`propsContent` arm slots the content UNDER the run; that is item 23's reading
one production lower down, and the alias is the whole difference (a run
followed by an alias is scanner-refuted anyway).

Nothing here is new BEHAVIOUR — item 24 edits no runtime file.  These are the
shapes whose accumulation changed, held fixed so a later runtime change cannot
move them silently.  §5 pins what is still accepted-only, and its two residues
have two different causes, neither of them the run.

/-! ## §1  An anchored or tagged value at the entry's indent

The run parks at the entry index; the next step reads the value as
`[156] ns-flow-content` at that same index and `[161]`'s `propsContent` arm
joins them.  The width is read off the landing, so 2 and 4 are one proof. -/

   "-STR"]

/-! ## §2  Both halves of `[96]`

The run EXTENDS on its own line (item 12's guard arithmetic, unchanged), and
the separator between the halves is the residual whites — `[66]`, which
mentions no indent, so the two-half run reads at the entry's index as well. -/

#guard emits "  - &a !t v\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ", "=VAL &a <!t> :v", "-SEQ", "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §3  Quoted values under a run

`[111]`/`[122]`'s one-line bodies are what item 23 lifted; slotting them under
the run costs the `SFlowContent` reading and nothing else. -/

/-! ## §4  The run with no value, siblings, and the mapping twin

`[161]`'s `( c-ns-properties e-scalar )` arm closes a run that never gets a
value (`PendingNode.propsClose`, now at every index).  A sibling `-` re-opens
rather than snocs — the props route carries the stream closure only — and the
mapping indicators reach the same run through `pendingMapValue`. -/

/-! ## §5  What the re-indexed route does NOT reach — accepted, derivation owed

Two residues, and the run is neither of them:

* `  - &a |` is `[198] s-l+block-scalar`'s props slot, whose `[170]`/`[174]`
  content indent is auto-detected — `SCLLiteral 0` pins `0 + m`, and
  `n + m' = 0 + m` needs `m ≥ n`, which a reading at 0 does not carry.  That is
  Reflection 647's shape one level down, and the SAME gap `  - |` has with no
  run at all.
* `  - &a [b]` is not a props question either: the flow collection re-enters
  through `FlowOpenStack`'s resume closure, whose argument is `SFlowContent 0
  .flowOut`, so it rides the opaque `scannerDrop` for exactly the reason
  `  - [1]` does.
* A value that FOLDS onto a second line is the case in which the index DOES
  occur, so there is nothing to lift. -/

/-! ## §6  A tab still refutes the indentation reading

Unchanged by the route's index: the scanner answers first, and these verdicts
are what a scanner-side refutation would have to read. -/

#guard verdicts "\t- &a v\n" == (some (.tabInIndentation 0 0), some (.tabInIndentation 0 0))
#guard verdicts "  \t- &a v\n" == (some (.tabInIndentation 0 2), some (.tabInIndentation 0 2))
