/-! # The compact key measures its own column (DOCS item 59)

An entry's index IS its indicator's column, and the park sits one character
past it — so a pending that carries its own column hands `[195]`'s compact
route the datum item 28 had to punt (`ImplicitKeyPack`'s column conjunct:
"the compact route cannot measure its own column").  With it, `- a:` opens its
value pending WITH a floor, and the value shapes that need one — the block
scalar and the multi-line scalar at the compact index — read there instead of
deferring.

ZERO runtime edits; every pin is an ACCEPT pin. -/
