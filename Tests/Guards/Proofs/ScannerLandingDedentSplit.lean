/-! # The under-run has two halves, and only one is a landing (DOCS item 64)

`WhiteRunUnderRun n` — what a landing's white run is when it fails to supply
`[63] s-indent(n)` — is `j < n` spaces followed by *the run's end* or *a tab*.
Item 64 separates the two:

* the **TAB** half is a scanner REFUSAL.  §6.1 forbids a tab at or left of the
  block's current indent, and `skipToContentWs` throws `tabInIndentation`
  there unless the line stops immediately (a comment, a break, end of input) —
  so a landing that carries a tab under the floor is never followed by the
  content the arm would have to read.  §1 and §2 pin the boundary the proof's
  arithmetic names: refused at every column at or left of `currentIndent`,
  accepted one column past it.

* the **run-end** half survives, and is the pure-space DEDENT
  (`FlowIndexLift.DedentLanding`).  §4 pins that it is INHABITED — these are
  accepted inputs whose value belongs to an enclosing collection, not to the
  entry the pending awaits — which is what makes the disjunct the proof now
  returns a claim rather than a formality.  §5 pins the edge of that domain:
  a dedent that lands between levels, or below all of them, is refused.

ZERO runtime edits: every pin below behaved this way before item 64 too.  The
item is a proof narrowing — it is `skipToContentWs`'s existing gate, carried
out of the preprocessing loop so the accumulation can spend it. -/

-- §1 The TAB half, at an indented pending whose `currentIndent` is 2: refused

-- §2 The boundary, which the item does not move: a tab one column PAST
-- `currentIndent` is `[66] s-separate-in-line`, and the value reads there.

-- §3 The three exits §6.1 leaves open, and which the proof's conclusion
-- therefore names (`pk = none ∨ pk = some '#'`): a tab under the floor is
-- legal when nothing follows it on the line.  The loop then crosses that

-- landing that matches NO open level is `trailingContent`, and one that
-- unwinds past every level restarts a document body without a marker.
