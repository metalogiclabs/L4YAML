/-! # Block scalars inside flow collections are rejected (DOCS item 9c)

`c-l+literal` [170] and `c-l+folded` [174] are reachable only through
`s-l+block-node` [196]; `ns-flow-content` [158] offers plain, flow-seq,
flow-map, single- and double-quoted only.  A block-scalar header inside a flow
collection therefore has no derivation, and before item 9c the scanner admitted
it — `[a, |⏎  x⏎]` scanned clean at 15 tokens in **both** pipelines, which is
what left β.3's flow-interior content step with an arm it could not refute.

These guards pin the strictening on both pipelines at once.  `yaml-test-suite`
has **no** case of this shape (a full sweep moved 0 of 406 cases), so the suite
scores cannot catch a regression here — this file is the only regression net.

/-- Legacy and indexed verdicts, as a comparable pair: `none` on success,
    `some e` on rejection.  Equal pairs mean the two pipelines agree. -/
private def verdicts (input : String) : Option ScanError × Option ScanError :=
  ( (match scan input with | .ok _ => none | .error e => some e)
  , (match Indexed.ScannerStateIx.scanIx input with | .ok _ => none | .error e => some e) )

  verdicts input == (some (.blockScalarInFlow indicator line col),
                     some (.blockScalarInFlow indicator line col))

/-! ## §1  The shapes item 9c rejects

Position is pinned too: a caller that reports the error must point at the
header, not at the enclosing collection. -/

/-! ## §2  Block context is untouched

The guard reads `s.inFlow`, so every `s-l+block-node` [196] position still
scans exactly as before. -/

#guard bothAccept "k: |\n  x\n"                  -- block mapping value
#guard bothAccept "k: >\n  x\n"                  -- folded
#guard bothAccept "- |\n  x\n"                   -- block sequence entry
#guard bothAccept "|\n  x\n"                     -- document root
#guard bothAccept "k: |-\n  x\n"                 -- with chomping indicator
#guard bothAccept "a:\n  b: |\n    x\n  c: 1\n"  -- nested, with a sibling after
#guard bothAccept "a: [1, 2]\nb: |\n  x\n"       -- after a flow collection closes
#guard bothAccept "- [1, 2]\n- |\n  x\n"         -- flow sibling, then block scalar

/-! ## §3  `|` and `>` that are *not* block-scalar headers

The guard fires on the dispatcher's `|`/`>` arm only, so these keep scanning:
quoted content never reaches it, and a plain scalar that merely *contains*
`|`/`>` is dispatched on its first character. -/

#guard bothAccept "[a, \"|\"]\n"
#guard bothAccept "{k: '>'}\n"
#guard bothAccept "[a>b]\n"
#guard bothAccept "[a|b]\n"

/-! ## §4  Flow basics, unchanged -/

#guard bothAccept "[a, b]\n"
#guard bothAccept "{a: 1, b: 2}\n"
#guard bothAccept "[]\n"
#guard bothAccept "[[a, [b, {c: [d]}]]]\n"

/-! ## §5  The proof-side handle

`dispatchContent_not_blockScalar_of_inFlow` is the fact item 9c exists to
provide: it is what lets β.3's flow-interior content step refute the
`SCLLiteral ∨ SCLFolded` disjuncts that `dispatchContent_evidence` still
offers.  Pinned by axiom profile, not by a `sorry`-free warning — a delegated
proof can be sorry-free and still ride `sorryAx` through a dependency. -/
