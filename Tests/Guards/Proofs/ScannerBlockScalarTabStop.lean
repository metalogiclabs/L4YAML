/-! # The block-scalar collection loop's TAB stop is refused (DOCS item 97)

The loop's non-empty stop is a line of fewer-than-indent spaces and then a
non-space non-break character.  When that character is a TAB the line derives
nowhere: `[167]`/`[168]`'s `s-indent(≤n)`/`s-indent(<n)` and `[169]
l-trail-comments`' head are all `[63] s-indent`, which is *spaces* (§6.1),
and nothing after the scalar can absorb the line either — a following
token's own indent is `[63]` too.  The preprocessing walk used to skip it
(its §6.1 gate exempts blank and comment landings), so both pipelines
accepted inputs the spec has no derivation for.

This is a RUNTIME narrowing: the accepts below were already accepts, the
refusals below were accepts and are now `tabInIndentation` — reported at the
stop line's own tab, by `scanBlockScalarBody`'s gate (legacy) and
`blockScalarTabStopErrIx` (indexed). -/

-- §1 The narrowed shape: the stop line opens with spaces (fewer than the
-- content indent) and then a TAB.  A `#` behind the tab does not save it —
-- `[169]`'s head indent is spaces-only.
#guard refuses "k: |\n  x\n\t# c\na: b\n"
-- One space, then the tab.
#guard refuses "k: |\n  x\n \t# c\na: b\n"

-- §3 The refusals the family already had keep their position: a tab line
-- with CONTENT behind it was refused by the walk's own §6.1 gate at the
