/-! # `- a: 1` — `[195] ns-l-compact-mapping` (DOCS item 38)

Item 37 left `pendingContent` and `pendingBlockContent` owing exactly one
production: `[154] ns-s-implicit-yaml-key` / `[155] c-s-implicit-json-key` read
at an anchor that is not a column-0 line start.  This file pins the half of it
that a block-sequence ENTRY asks for.

`- a: 1` is `[185] s-l+block-indented`'s second alternative,
`s-indent(m) ns-l-compact-mapping(n+1+m)`: a mapping whose first entry has no
`s-indent` and no `s-l-comments` in front of it, because its key sits on the
same line as the `-` that opened the sequence entry.  The KEY head is the one
items 15–17 already read — `a` here reads exactly as the `a` of `a: 1` — and
what was missing was the FRAME.  Item 38 stopped writing the frame as the three
coordinates one producer happens to have (a column-0 landing, the stream closed
there, `[63] s-indent(k)` in front of the key) and started writing it as the
one thing the consumer does with them: a route from the finished `[188]` entry
back into the stream.  With that, `compactMapRoute` is a second producer of the
same pack and `- a: 1` composes where `a: 1` did.

§1 pins the compact mapping itself.  §2 pins it composing — siblings, nesting,
and the enclosing collection closing over it.  §3 pins the shapes whose pack
still punts: they PARSE, and what they are missing is a route, which is the
next item's business, not a defect.  §4 pins the boundary the scanner keeps.

/-! ## §1  The compact mapping

One entry, opened by a key on the `-`'s own line.  The `s-indent(m)` in front
of the key is the whites between the indicator and the content — `m = 1` for a
single space, and `[195]`'s index is `n+1+m`, one for the `-` itself. -/

/-! ## §3  What still punts

These PARSE.  What their pack cannot build is a route, and each is a different
construct rather than a weaker instance of `[195]`:

* `-⏎  a: 1` crossed a break, so the mapping opens under `[79] s-l-comments` —
  `[185]`'s FIRST alternative, a nested collection, which wants the enclosing
  index bounded by the inner one;
* `- &p a: 1` parks a `[96] c-ns-properties` run, whose own pack is item 17's
  `PropsKeyPack` and whose route is the run's — item 41 gave that pack this
  item's route too, so this one composes now
  (`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ScannerEntryPropsKey.lean`);
* `- [1]: b` opens a FLOW collection, and its resume is `FlowOpenStack`'s
  pinned index — the row's other family entirely;
* `k:⏎  a: 1` is the same missing route one construct over, on the mapping
  VALUE's pending rather than the sequence entry's.

Pinning them here is what keeps the next item honest: the boundary is a list of
named routes, not a vague remainder. -/

/-! ## §4  The boundary

`[63] s-indent(m)` is SPACES, and the scanner says so before any of this is
reached (items 31/32).  A second `:` on the line is not a second key — §7.5's
tail admits one — and item 37's refutation at this very pending is unchanged by
the arm added in front of it. -/

#guard !scanAccepts "- \ta: 1\n" && rejectsAlike "- \ta: 1\n"
#guard !scanAccepts "-\ta: 1\n" && rejectsAlike "-\ta: 1\n"
-- A second `:` on the line: the scanner ACCEPTS it (`b:` is plain content
-- until the `:` resolves) and the parser refuses — a row-19 over-acceptance of
-- the token stream, the same shape item 37 measured at `"a" :b`.
#guard scanAccepts "- a: b: c\n" && rejects "- a: b: c\n"
-- Item 37, at the pending this item extended: `-` and `?` are still refused.
#guard !scanAccepts "- \"a\" - b\n" && rejects "- \"a\" - b\n"
#guard rejects "- [1] ? b\n"
-- …and a `-` after a compact mapping's value is plain-scalar content, not an
-- entry: `[128] ns-plain-safe-out` absorbs it (item 37 §3).
#guard emits "- a: 1 - b\n"
