/-! # The two floorless producers measure their own push (DOCS item 63)

`[183] l+block-sequence(n)` and `[187] l+block-mapping(n)` are opened by
`pushSequenceIndent` / `pushMappingIndent`, both at the INDICATOR's column —
so a pending's index is discharged by the push it was created alongside.
Items 27/28 proved that for the `-`, the `?` and the `:`, and packaged it
(`dash_floor`, `key_floor_or`, `value_floor_or`, `value_key_floor_or`); two
producers were still handing `IndentFloor … ∨ True` its right disjunct:

* `compact_open_map` — the KEYLESS compact routes `- : v` and `- ? k`
  (`[195] ns-l-compact-mapping`), whose index is the indicator's column, one
  past the `-` at `s-indent(n)` plus `[185]`'s own `s-indent(m)`;
* `colon_open_map_props` — the props-decorated implicit key `&a : v`, whose
  index is the PROPERTY's column, the one `PropsKeyPack` already carried.

With the floors paid, the value shapes that need one — the block scalar and
the multi-line scalar at that index — read there instead of deferring.

ZERO runtime edits; every pin is an ACCEPT pin, and each was an accept
before. -/
