/-! # A compact `?` is a `[186]` explicit key like any other (DOCS item 105)

Items 101–103 emptied `KeyPackPunt.implicitValue`'s three parks by refutation:
`[189]`'s value slot stamps its line and §8.2.2 refuses a second value
indicator there.  `noFrame` is the OTHER half of that split — the park with no
frame and no stamp — and it is not a refutation but a missing payment.

The name has been carrying the wrong input.  Item 101 recorded the residue as
the EXPLICIT value slot (`?⏎: b: c`, `? a⏎: b: c`), but both of those are
served: the landed `:` at a `pendingMapValue` reads the `?` frame off `h_expl`
(item 51) and re-parks through `colon_open_map_explicit`, whose `h_vslot` is a
real slot, so the mid-line `:` after `b` composes through `[195]`.  The park
that actually reaches `noFrame` is the COMPACT `?` — `- ? a: b` — whose
producer (`compact_open_map`) handed `Or.inr trivial` for both fields where the
column-0 producer (`question_open_map`) has paid them since item 51.

Nothing about the KEY differs between the two.  `[195] ns-l-compact-mapping`'s
first entry is an ordinary `[188]`, so the `?` heading it is `[186]
c-l-block-map-explicit-key` and owns the same two things: the entry ROUTE that
keeps it open until its `:` value line lands, and the `[186]` KEY SLOT with the
compact alternatives inside it.  Both factor through one route into the
enclosing entry's closure, which is `compactExplicitKeyFrame`.

Everything pinned below is RUNTIME behavior and none of it changed at this
item — no runtime file is touched.  The pins say what the proof's new payment
has to be consistent with; an escape is silent, so no runtime observation can
say which arm a given input takes. -/

/-! ## §6 The payment at its type

One route into the enclosing entry's closure yields both fields.  The `?`
literal is the only premise beyond the frame `compact_open_map` already
holds — which is why the two producers differ in nothing but the route. -/
