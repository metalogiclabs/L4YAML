/-! # The census over CONCLUSIONS (DOCS items 201, 202)

Item 198 ran a census over the pending park's CONSTRUCTORS, asking which of
them carried both bottoms; item 200 ran one over their APPLICATION SITES,
asking which sites paid a field and punted its own weakening.  Both items
recorded, in the same words, the row neither could reach:

> Both censuses run over the park family.  Neither runs over lemma
> CONCLUSIONS, so `flowKeyRoute_of_root` — which carries a value-line-bottomed
> resume conjunct and punts it — is still unmeasured.  **A census over
> conclusions is the instrument that would find it, and nobody has built one.**

This is that instrument.  For every non-internal constant of
`L4YAML/Proofs/Production/StreamAccum.lean`, split the TYPE into its binder
telescope and its conclusion, collect the `_ ∨ True` components of the
CONCLUSION, and read the VALUE for an `Or.inl` and an `Or.inr` of each.  A
conjunct with no `Or.inl` anywhere in the proof is one no arm of that lemma
ever pays — which is a different question from "is this field punted at some
site", and is the one the park censuses cannot ask.

**What it reads.**  16 lemmas state an optional conjunct in their conclusion,
24 conjuncts between them — of which **18 have a paying arm and 6 have none**.
Three lemmas carry more than one, and they are the same lemma seen three ways:
`flowKeyRoute_of_open` (5), `flowKeyRoute_of_root` (5) and the field that
carries both (`FlowBaseRoutes.key`, 5, excluded below as a projection).
**Conclusion-level optionality in this module is the flow-key lane and nothing
else.**

~~**All six unpaid rows are the RELAY blind spot below** (item 203).~~  Item
202 read seven, of which exactly one was unpaid and not a relay —
`flowKeyRoute_of_open`'s value-line resume — and item 203 paid it.  ~~So the
first column's remainder is entirely the instrument's own blind spot and not
the file's.~~  **Measured at item 212 and false.**  Narrowing the four
single-conjunct rows to `_ ∨ False` and building reads FOUR different
mechanisms, not one — and one of them is a decline:

* `scanValue_ok_park_facts` **DECLINES**, at StreamAccum `L18463`, on one
  branch of a `split`.  It is not relayed at all; its `Or.inl` and its
  `Or.inr` are both written in its own proof and both land in the `un` column
  — which is item 202's KEY, a third time, and not the relay.  **The number
  that refutes the sentence above is `un=1,1` in the pin below, put there to
  catch exactly this and read by nobody.**
* `back_col` relays a structure FIELD of `KmSound`, so what decides it is
  every site that BUILDS a `KmSound` — items 198 and 200's census, not this
  one's.
* `close_col_of_base` relays `back_col` with `Or.imp` and is repaired by
  narrowing `back_col` alongside it: it pays exactly when `back_col` does, and
  nothing here can say whether that is.
* `flowKeyHead` relays into `flowNode_toBlockKey`, which is in
  `FlowKeyLift` — **another module**, which `subjects` filters out by
  construction.  The census cannot follow it however hard it looks.

The supply direction now has its own instrument
(`Tests/Guards/Proofs/RelaySupplyCensus.lean`, item 212), which follows a
`have` through its beta-redex and a case split into its alternatives.  The
CONCLUSION direction — these four — is still followed by hand, by narrowing
and building.

## The key, and why item 202 had to correct it

Two conjuncts are "the same" here when their head-constant SKELETONS agree,
and item 201 took the skeleton over ALL constants.  That key is
instantiation-SENSITIVE, which the docstring it was written in denied: a
conjunct paid at a COMPUTED index carries the index's own constants
(`HAdd.hAdd`, `instHAdd`, `OfNat.ofNat`, …) into the skeleton and matches
nothing.  `flowKeyRoute_of_open` pays at `k = nc + 1 + w`, so item 201 read
four of its five fields wrong and reported the module as 15-paying/9-unpaid
when it was 16/8 — and handed item 202 a plan sentence ("`_of_open`'s four
never-paid conjuncts") of which two were paid all along.

The key here keeps only constants under `L4YAML`, which an index cannot
introduce, and falls back to the full skeleton where that leaves nothing.  The
correction is not asserted: `attribControl` below reads BOTH keys and pins the
lemmas where they disagree, so the module states for itself that exactly one
lemma is instantiation-sensitive and that the grammar key attributes strictly
more of its sites.

## The two blind spots that remain, named

* A conjunct **relayed** with `Or.imp` (`h.imp f id`), or discharged by passing
  a lemma whose own conclusion is the `∨ True`, writes no literal `Or.inl` or
  `Or.inr` and reads `inl=0 inr=0` — neither paid nor punted.  ~~`flowKeyHead`,
  `back_col`, `close_col_of_base` and `scanValue_ok_park_facts` are the first
  kind and the two `head` conjuncts are the second, and all six DO pay.~~
  **Item 212: three kinds, not one, and `scanValue_ok_park_facts` is not
  relayed and does not pay — see the correction above.**  The blind spot
  itself is real, and is the same one item 199 measured in the `[210]` flip, in
  a second instrument: **a relay is invisible to anything that counts terms**,
  because it writes the answer down once and the writing is not at either end.
  Its SIZE is now measured rather than described: 345 of the module's 659
  optional-premise supply edges, 52 %, are decided somewhere other than the
  site that writes them (`RelaySupplyCensus`).
* `inr` counts punt SITES, not "always punted".  A payment that keeps a
  fallback arm — every payment made through a `match` on an optional premise —
  leaves the `inr` count exactly where it was.  Item 201's own payment moved
  `flowKeyRoute_of_root`'s two rows `inl=0 → inl=1` and `inr=2 → inr=2`.

So the number to read is the FIRST column.  The `un=` column is the third
thing a term census cannot attribute — an `Or.inl`/`Or.inr` written for an
optional PREMISE rather than a conclusion conjunct — pinned rather than
filtered, so a payment the key stops seeing has to move a number here. -/
