/-! # The flow open's park arm (DOCS item 78)

Item 75 threaded the column of the key a depth-0 `[`/`{` STACKS all the way to
the matching close, and left it optional at both ends: the frame offered `kc = k`
only when the park could say whether preprocessing had re-saved, and the close
spent it against a mask that may have been collapsed.

Items 76 and 77 answered the park's half between them — off a line start the
walk's own break re-arms `simpleKeyAllowed`, at one the park carries the flag —
and this item reads the two as ONE datum on the pending
(`PendingNode.arm_or_col`) and spends it at the open.  So `FlowBaseRoutes.key`
carries the equation itself, and what a close still decides per input is the
MASK's promise alone.

§1–§3 are the compile-time witnesses: the datum is uniform over the nine
`false`-indexed constructors, the two route lemmas deliver an EQUATION rather
than an option, and the close's pack has one funder left.  §4 is the
measurement, which is what says the two funders are exhaustive on real input:
at every depth-0 flow open the saved key is FRESH whenever the park was armed,
and INHERITED from the park otherwise. -/

/-! ## §1  The datum is uniform over the pendings

The four content parks got their flag-or-column from item 77 and `noPending`
from item 76; the two indicator parks carried `simpleKeyAllowed` outright since
items 34/58 and the props park its column since item 68.  Nine constructors,
one disjunction — so a consumer that only needs THIS need not case on the
pending at all, which is what lets the flow open take the measurement once,
ahead of its own split. -/

example {sc : ScannerState} {sp_start sp_block sp_scan : SurfPos}
    (h_noflow : sc.inFlow = false)
    (h : PendingNode sc false sp_start sp_block sp_scan) :
    sc.simpleKeyAllowed = true ∨ 0 < sp_scan.col :=
  h.arm_or_col h_noflow

/-! ## §2  The route lemmas deliver an equation, not an option

Both arms of each lemma now measure.  The ROOT needs no premise beyond the
datum: its landed arm has the walk's re-arm and its no-break arm IS the park at
column 0, where the datum's other disjunct is refuted by arithmetic. -/

/-! ## §3  …and the close's pack carries its column

The frame's half is an equation (item 78) and the MASK's is one too (item 79),
so the pack's column conjunct is derived at this producer rather than offered.
What is still optional here is the key ROUTE — a fact about the enclosing
construct, not a measurement — and, since item 103, the open's stamp reading,
which is a fact about the input and is what names the punt where the route is
absent. -/

is what would fail if a park reached a bracket carrying neither. -/
