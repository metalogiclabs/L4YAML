/-! # `k:⏎  a: 1` — the mapping nested in a `[189]` VALUE (DOCS item 39)

Item 38 replaced `ImplicitKeyPack`'s three coordinates with the one thing its
consumer does with them — a route from the finished `[188]` entry back into the
stream — and used the room that made to give `- a: 1` its own frame.  This file
pins the family that came next for free: the entry whose mapping is the VALUE of
an enclosing entry.

The frame is `[199] s-l+block-collection` under the node `k:` is waiting for,
with `[187] l+block-mapping`'s auto-detected width set to the column the key
actually landed at (`nestedBlockMap`, the mapping twin of item 30's
`nestedBlockSeq`).  Nothing else moved: the key head is items 15–17's, read by
`implicitKeyHead_of_dispatch` exactly as it reads `a: 1`'s and `- a: 1`'s, the
pack is unchanged, and `colon_fires_implicit_key` does not know there is a third
producer.

Between this route and the root one the landing is the SAME measurement — a
break crossed to column 0, with `[63] s-indent(k)` in front of the key.  What
differs is which `[79] s-l-comments` occurrence it fills: `[211]`'s implicit
continuation for the root mapping, `[199]`'s own leading comments here.  One
reading of the characters, two productions that want it — and because this route
crosses a break to a known zero, it also RECOVERS the floor conjunct the compact
route had to punt (§2's block scalars read their bodies at the entry's index).

§1 pins the value mapping itself.  §2 pins it composing — siblings, nesting,
dedent, and the two ways the enclosing entry can be opened.  §3 pins the shapes
whose pack still punts; they PARSE, and each is a different construct rather
than a weaker instance of this one.  §4 pins the boundary the scanner keeps.

/-! ## §1  The value mapping

One entry, opened at a landing INSIDE the node an enclosing `k:` is waiting for.
The `s-indent(k)` in front of the key is the whites between the landing and the
content, and `k` is the key's own column — `[187]`'s auto-detected width, which
`nestedBlockMap` sets to `k - n` rather than inlining it. -/

/-! ## §2  Composing

Siblings at the nested width, a second level, the dedent that ends the nested
map, the landing's own comment and blank lines, and the two other ways a
`pendingMapValue` at column 0 is opened (`[189]`'s empty key, `[186]`'s explicit
one).  The block scalars are the floor conjunct's pin: their bodies are read
against the ENTRY's index, which is what this route recovers and the compact
route (item 38) had to punt. -/

/-! ## §3  What still punts

Each of these PARSES; what the pack hands the `:` is `True`.  None of them is a
weaker instance of §1 — each names a construct with its own frame, which is what
makes the residue a list of routes rather than a residue.

The first is this item's own boundary and the reason the route is confined to
`n = 0`: at an INDENTED `pendingMapValue` a landing can be a dedent, and then
`n ≤ k` is false — the enclosing entry has ended, so there is no mapping to nest
inside its value. -/

/-! ## §4  The boundary

What the scanner refuses outright, what it accepts and the parser refuses (row
19's business, unchanged by this item), and what `[128] ns-plain-safe-out`
