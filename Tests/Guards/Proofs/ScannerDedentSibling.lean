/-! # The DEDENT composes as a sibling (DOCS item 99)

A landing that under-runs an indented pending's index ends the awaited entry:
the entry closes EMPTY (`[185]`'s comment form / `[72]`'s empty node) and the
landed content is a SIBLING at an enclosing mapping level — the parser emits
ONE outer mapping (`k:⏎  :⏎b: 2` is `{k: {null: null}, b: 2}`), never a
nested reading and never a refusal.  Item 64 LOCATED this landing
(`DedentLanding`, `KeyPackPunt.dedent`) and both consumers deferred it; item
99 drains the deferral at the two indented content arms
(`content_dispatch_after_close` off the e-noded close, the landing's own
`s-indent(j)` as the key context) and builds the frames the honest
entries-level cons needs (`ResumeFrames` — the still-open mapping levels,
each held as its `[195]`-tail continuation), which is where R4's
`implicitContinue`/`0 < m` tightening sends the equal-width sibling.

§1 pins the dedent family ACCEPTED with sibling-shaped events in both
pipelines; §2 the unmoved neighbors; §3 the standing refusals; §4 the frames
machinery at its types (at the STREAM bottom — item 108 made the bottom a
parameter without moving any of this). -/

example {sp_start sp : SurfPos} (h : ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) [2, 0] sp) :

/-- The level constructor demands the strict ordering, and this stack's bottom
    is the stream — the two invariants every producer of THIS instantiation
    pays.  The bottom became a parameter at item 108, where the same stack over
    the explicit frame's value line keeps a `?` open across a dedent
    (`ScannerDedentKeepsExplicitFrame`); everything here is that construct at
    `SLYamlStream sp_start` and is unchanged by it. -/
example {sp_start sp : SurfPos}
    (h_cont : ∀ sp_end, SCompactMapTail 3 sp sp_end →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) [1] sp_end) :
    ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) [3, 1] sp :=
  ResumeFrames.level 3 [1] sp (by simp) h_cont

/-- `rootMapRouteF` seeds the stack: the entry plus its whole tail close the
    root mapping over the bottomed stream. -/
