/-! # The last two implicit-key heads: properties and alias (DOCS item 17)

`&a x: v` and `*a : b` join items 15/16's plain and quoted keys as GRAMMAR,
and they cost no new carrier arm: `[188] ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`'s two
alternatives read a plain scalar and a FLOW NODE, and `[161] ns-flow-node(0,
block-key)` already names an alias (`[104] c-ns-alias-node`) and a
property-prefixed node (`c-ns-properties s-separate ns-flow-content`) among its
own arms.  Item 16's key head enumerated three SCANNER branches; item 17 re-cut
it along the PRODUCTION's seam — two arms, one per alternative of `[188]` — and
both remaining heads landed inside the ones already there.

What each head needed beyond that:

* the ALIAS head, nothing at all.  `ns-anchor-char` excludes `s-white` and
  `b-char`, so an alias cannot cross a break; there is no one-line reading to
  prove and no line hypothesis to discharge, and the production is
  context-free, so the scan's own evidence reads at `block-key` directly.
* the PROPS head, one datum carried forward.  The key a following `:`
  validates was saved when the run OPENED (a property push is not a key save),
  so the run's pending carries "that key is still on this line" to the step
  that scans the content — which is exactly the hypothesis items 15/16's
  one-line readings ask for.  `[96]`'s optional second half embeds an
  `s-separate`, so a two-half run (`&a !t x: v`) re-reads at `block-key` only
  because the extension arm built that separator from residual whites.

The pins below fix the composed shapes — both halves of `[96]` in both orders,
every content head under a run, the alias key with its value forms — and the
neighbours that must not move.

/-! ## §2  The alias head — `[104] c-ns-alias-node` as `[161]`'s alias arm

An alias key needs a defined anchor (§7.1), so the composed shapes are all
siblings of an earlier entry; and it needs the separating space, because
`ns-anchor-char` admits `:` — `*a:` is one anchor NAME, not an alias and a
value indicator (§4). -/

/-! ## §4  The neighbours — must NOT move, identical in BOTH pipelines -/

-- parser then refuses the bare document that results.

#guard verdicts "*a : b\n" == (some (.undefinedAlias "a" 0 0), some (.undefinedAlias "a" 0 0))
-- `ns-anchor-char` is `ns-char` minus the FLOW indicators, so `:` is part of
-- the NAME: `*a: b` is an alias to `a:`, not an alias key.  Both pipelines
-- reject; they disagree only on WHICH check fires first when an undefined
-- alias is also followed by content (legacy resolves, indexed delimits) — an
-- error-stage difference of the verdict-equal class item 14 catalogued, not a
-- difference in what is accepted.
