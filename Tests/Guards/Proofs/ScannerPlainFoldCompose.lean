/-! # The multi-line PLAIN value reads at the entry's index (DOCS item 54)

The plain twin of item 53: `collectPlainScalar_handleBlockLineBreak`'s own
under-indent guard (`col < contentIndent → terminate`) is the reading's
justification at any `n ≤ contentIndent` — `handleBlockLineBreak_prod_at` /
`collectPlainScalarLoop_prod_at` / `scanPlainScalar_to_flowNode_at` re-run
the 0-inductions, and the analysis lemma's fold disjunct (now carrying the
plain walk's trailing whites) serves both indented arms.  ZERO runtime
edits: every pin is an ACCEPT pin with the folded event shape. -/
