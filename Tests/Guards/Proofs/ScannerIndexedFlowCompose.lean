/-! # Flow collections at a nonzero reading index (DOCS item 46)

Item 46 threads the reading index through the accumulation: the flow stack
opens at the PENDING'S index, so an indented entry's flow value —
`  - [1]`, `  a: [1,2]`, `  - &a [b]` — re-enters the stream through the
resume instead of riding `scannerDrop`, and a mid-flight renounce event (an
under-run landing, a multi-line scalar token) collapses the stack to a shape
that closes through the ONE remaining drop.

§1 pins the served family: every shape here is scanner- and parser-accepted,
and after item 46 its derivation runs through the real resume (the
accumulation compiles those arms with no escape).  §2 pins the collapse's
DOMAIN — the accepted inputs whose grammar reading at the entry's index does
not exist (spec-invalid, R2's class), which stay with the drop — and the
neighbours the scanner refuses outright.  All verdicts are unchanged from
before the item (zero runtime edits); what the pins fix is the boundary the
DOCS text claims.

/-! ## §2  The floor, closed (item 50), and the refused neighbours

Four shapes used to be accepted here although the reading at the entry's
index does not exist (`[69] s-flow-line-prefix(n)` fails on the landing) —
the derivation renounced and rode the drop.  Item 50 closes the floor: the
`]`/`}` exemption is gone from the structural guard (`[137]`/`[140]` sit
inside `s-l+flow-in-block(n)`'s `ns-flow-node(n+1)`, so the closers clear
the same floor), the fold's §6.1 tab gate applies in flow, and a flow plain
continuation is checked against the enclosing block indent. -/

#guard rejected "k:\n  - [1,\n]\n"
#guard rejected "k:\n  a: {b: 1,\n}\n"
