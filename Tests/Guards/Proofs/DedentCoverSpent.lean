/-! # The dedent landing spends the cover (DOCS item 149)

Item 148 carried a cover from a root down an unbounded chain of nested implicit
keys and left ONE branch punting: `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`'s dedent, where the
landing pops to a level below the park's own.  The reason it named was a
mismatch of lists — the park's cover is over the whole of `ks`, the pack the
landing opens carries `w :: ks'`, and `ks'` drops every width above `w`.

The mismatch is real and it is not a list fact.  What reads the one list as the
other is the landing's own FLOOR: preprocessing's unwind stopped at `w`, so the
stack it hands the dispatch has nothing above `w` left to name.  Three things
had to be true at once; item 148 named all three, and one of them one half
short:

* `ResumeFrames.resumeAt` had to say WHICH widths survive, not just that they
  are below `w`.  The bound is satisfied by the empty list, and so is the
  SUBLIST reading item 148 named — that one is half the answer (it is what the
  floor spends), and the half the cover spends is COMPLETENESS: nothing strictly
  below the landing was dropped (§1).
* `Mono` had to reach the content lane, because the floor bounds the TOP and
  the cover asks about every entry (§2).
* The floor itself had to be measured, which is `landing_floor_of_arm` off the
  landed arm the pack lemma already destructures (§3).

Two of the three cost no new scanner reading at all: `resumeAt`'s own recursion
already visits the strict decrease it needed, and the floor is item 147's lemma
applied to an arm the branch already had in hand.  The third is a premise, and
`Mono` rides the accumulation down beside item 146's base.

§1 is what `resumeAt` reports.  §2 is the two hops and what each needs.  §3 is
the payment composed, with the punts removed.  §4 checks the floor against the
scanner.  §5 is the price and what still does not pay. -/

/-! ## §1  What `resumeAt` reports

A landing at `j` closes the levels above it and keeps the rest.  Which rest is
the question the surface never had to ask and the scanner cannot do without. -/

/-- The widths, named. -/
example (ks ks' : List Nat) (j : Nat) :
    ResumeWidths ks ks' j ↔ ∀ k', k' ∈ ks' ↔ (k' ∈ ks ∧ k' < j) := Iff.rfl

/-- A landing at 2 on a three-level stack keeps exactly the level at 0. -/
example : ResumeWidths [4, 2, 0] [0] 2 := by
  intro k'
  constructor
  · intro h; simp at h; subst h; exact ⟨by simp, by omega⟩
  · rintro ⟨h, hlt⟩; simp at h; rcases h with rfl | rfl | rfl <;> simp_all

/-- **The bound alone cannot say that**: `∀ k' ∈ ks', k' < j` is satisfied by
    the EMPTY list, so a caller holding it knows nothing about which frames
    survived. -/
example : ∀ k' ∈ ([] : List Nat), k' < 2 := by simp

/-- **Nor can a SUBLIST** — the reading item 148 named, which is one of the two
    halves and not the one that was missing.  A sublist IS what the floor spends
    (`Floor.pop_to`: every surviving width was a frame the park had already
    bounded); the half the COVER spends is completeness, and a sublist cannot
    supply it, since `[]` is a sublist of every list. -/
example : ([] : List Nat).Sublist [4, 2, 0] := by simp

/-- The named form refuses both: level 0 is below the landing, so it is
    still a frame and the empty list is not what the landing leaves. -/
example : ¬ ResumeWidths [4, 2, 0] [] 2 := by
  intro h
  have := (h 0).mpr ⟨by simp, by omega⟩
  simp at this

/-- The two projections the payment spends: what survived was a frame
    already… -/
example {ks ks' : List Nat} {j : Nat} (h : ResumeWidths ks ks' j) :
    ∀ k' ∈ ks', k' ∈ ks := h.sub

/-- …and nothing below the landing was dropped. -/
example {ks ks' : List Nat} {j : Nat} (h : ResumeWidths ks ks' j) :
    ∀ k' ∈ ks, k' < j → k' ∈ ks' := h.keep

/-! ## §2  The two hops

The frames' bound travels for free; the stack's cover does not. -/

/-- **The floor does not move.**  `w` is one of the frames the park already
    bounded, and so is every width the landing keeps — so the bound the park
    carried reaches the whole of the new list without being re-measured.

    Note which half of `Floor` does the work: the WIDTHS half, `∀ k' ∈ ks,
    lo ≤ k'`, which is the one item 148 added.  The index half `lo ≤ n` is
    carried across this hop and never read — it is the NESTED branch that
    spends it (`Floor.mono_index`), and the two branches of the key dispatch
    are what make both halves live. -/
example {lo n w : Nat} {ks ks' : List Nat}
    (h : Floor lo n ks) (hmem : w ∈ ks) (hsub : ∀ k' ∈ ks', k' ∈ ks) :
    Floor lo w (w :: ks') := h.pop_to hmem hsub

/-- **The cover is re-listed, and that needs the machine.**  The landing's floor
    bounds the TOP; monotonicity turns that into a bound on every entry; and the
    entries at or left of `w` are the frames the landing kept. -/
example {lo w : Nat} {ks ks' : List Nat} {s : ScannerState}
    (h_mono : Mono s) (h_top : s.currentIndent ≤ (w : Int))
    (h_keep : ∀ k' ∈ ks, k' < w → k' ∈ ks')
    (h : Covered lo ks s) : Covered lo (w :: ks') s :=
  h.pop_to h_mono h_top h_keep

/-- A stack that is NOT monotone, for the refutation below: the top is at 1
    while an entry at 5 stands under it. -/
private def unsorted : ScannerState :=
  { ScannerState.mk' "" with
    indents := #[{ column := -1, isSequence := false },
                 { column := 5, isSequence := false },
                 { column := 1, isSequence := false }] }

example : unsorted.currentIndent = 1 := by
  simp [unsorted, ScannerState.currentIndent]

example : Covered 0 [5, 1] unsorted := by
  intro e he _ hnn
  simp [unsorted] at he
  rcases he with rfl | rfl | rfl <;> simp_all

example : ¬ Covered 0 [1] unsorted := by
  intro h
  have := h { column := 5, isSequence := false } (by simp [unsorted]) rfl (by simp)
  simp at this

/-- **`Mono` is load-bearing, not decoration.**  Drop it and the same three
    remaining hypotheses hold of `unsorted` at `w = 1` — the top is at 1, and
    no frame of `[5, 1]` is strictly below 1 — while the conclusion is false. -/
example : ¬ (∀ (lo w : Nat) (ks ks' : List Nat) (s : ScannerState),
    s.currentIndent ≤ (w : Int) → (∀ k' ∈ ks, k' < w → k' ∈ ks') →
    Covered lo ks s → Covered lo (w :: ks') s) := by
  intro h
  refine absurd (h 0 1 [5, 1] [] unsorted
    (by simp [unsorted, ScannerState.currentIndent])
    (by intro k' hk' hlt; simp at hk'; rcases hk' with rfl | rfl <;> omega)
    (by
      intro e he _ hnn
      simp [unsorted] at he
      rcases he with rfl | rfl | rfl <;> simp_all)) ?_
  intro hc
  have := hc { column := 5, isSequence := false } (by simp [unsorted]) rfl (by simp)
  simp at this

/-! ## §3  The payment, composed

This is `dedent_cover_of_landing`'s body with all three of its escapes removed —
the caller's stack readings, the park's carried cover, and the line-start park —
so what it produces is the LEFT disjunct rather than the field's `∨ True`. -/

example {sc s_prep s' : ScannerState} {c : Char} {sp_scan : SurfPos}
    {n w lo : Nat} {ks ks' : List Nat}
    (h_mono : Mono sc) (h_base : SentinelBase sc)
    (h_fl : Floor lo n ks) (h_cv : Covered lo ks sc) (hmem : w ∈ ks)
    (h_larm : sp_scan.col ≠ 0 → s_prep.inFlow = false →
      s_prep.simpleKey.possible = true ∧ s_prep.simpleKey.pos.col = s_prep.col ∧
      s_prep.simpleKeyAllowed = true ∧
      (s_prep.currentIndent ≤ (s_prep.col : Int) ∨ s_prep.indents.size ≤ 1))
    (hc0 : sp_scan.col ≠ 0) (h_scol : s_prep.col = w)
    (h_pre : scanNextToken_preprocess sc = .ok (some (s_prep, c)))
    (h_ind_eq : s'.indents = s_prep.indents)
    (h_noflow : s_prep.inFlow = false)
    (h_step : ∀ (lo : Nat) (ks : List Nat), Covered lo ks sc → Covered lo ks s')
    (h_w : ResumeWidths ks ks' w) :
    Floor lo w (w :: ks') ∧ Covered lo (w :: ks') s' :=
  ⟨h_fl.pop_to hmem h_w.sub,

       exact landing_floor_of_arm h_noflow h_larm hc0 h_base h_pre)
     h_w.keep⟩

/-- The lemma both pack lemmas actually call, at its type.  The escapes are
    `h_cov` (a caller that cannot measure its stack), `h_dcov` (a park whose
    frames carry no cover), and the park's own column — and nothing else: every
    other premise is discharged from what the accumulation already threads. -/
example {sc s_prep s' : ScannerState} {c : Char} {sp_scan : SurfPos}
    {n w : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (h_cov : (Mono sc ∧ SentinelBase sc) ∨ True)

  dedent_cover_of_landing h_cov h_dcov hmem h_larm h_scol h_pre h_ind_eq
    h_noflow h_step ks' h_w

/-- And the field it lands in: the pack the dedent branch returns carries the
    cover over the widths the landing resumed on. -/

    (h : ImplicitKeyPack sc sp_start sp_scan) :

  exact ⟨k, sp_key, h_resF⟩

/-! ## §4  The floor, against the scanner

`landing_floor_of_arm` says a landing that crossed a break has its floor — the
top at or left of the column it unwound to — unless the stack popped all the way
to the sentinel.  The walk below checks that on every step whose preprocessing
actually POPPED, and counts those steps so a future change cannot make the check
vacuous by never reaching one.  It also counts the parks the payment declines:
a park AT a line start, whose walk crossed nothing and so armed no unwind. -/

private def landingFacts (s : ScannerState) : Nat × Nat × Nat × Nat :=
  match scanNextToken_preprocess s with
  | .ok (some (s', _)) =>
      if s'.indents.size < s.indents.size then
        let floored := decide (s'.currentIndent ≤ (s'.col : Int))
        let sentinel := decide (s'.indents.size ≤ 1)
        (1, if floored then 1 else 0,
            if s.col == 0 then 1 else 0,
            if floored || sentinel then 0 else 1)
      else (0, 0, 0, 0)
  | _ => (0, 0, 0, 0)

/-- States seen; steps whose preprocessing popped the stack; those with the
    landing's own floor; those whose PARK stood at a line start (the payment's
    declined case); and those with neither the floor nor the sentinel — the
    shape `landing_floor_of_arm` says cannot occur off an armed walk. -/

/-! ## §5  The price, and what still does not pay

**The price.**  Seven new declarations: `ResumeWidths` with its three
projections and `dedent_cover_of_landing` — the payment, written once for both
pack lemmas — in `StreamAccum`, and `Floor.pop_to` with `Covered.pop_to` in
`IndentStackCover`.  `ResumeFrames.resumeAt`'s conclusion is restated and its
thirteen consumers migrated (ten needed a textual change; the three that already
projected the bound away with `_` did not).  Six declarations gain a premise:
`h_dframes`' cover conjunct and `h_cov` at both pack lemmas, and `Mono` with
`SentinelBase` threading down the content lane beside item 146's base.  At the
twelve pack-lemma call sites the bundle is real at the six `pendingMapValue`
parks and a punt at the other six, and six of the seven places item 147's field
was projected down to its widths now pass it through unchanged.

**What still does not pay.**

* **The membership split.**  The branch still runs `by_cases hmem : w ∈ ks` and
  punts when the landing names no frame.  `preprocess_landing_mem_or_seq` derives
  that membership from the cover it now has in hand — but it wants the park's
  `SentinelBase`, `s_prep.indents ≠ sc.indents`, and a refutation of the SEQUENCE
  disjunct, which `IndentStackCover.landing_mem_of_value` settles a step LATER at
  the `:` and the pack cannot.
* **A park at a line start.**  The walk that reached the landing crossed nothing,
  so preprocessing armed no unwind and there is no floor to measure — item 147's
  own residue, at the indicator lane's payers as well.
* **The value-line stack.**  `h_dframesV` carries no cover at all; the `?` frame's
  levels are a different stack and nothing measures it yet.
* **Sequence parks.**  `pendingBlock`'s two faces carry no cover on either side,
  so their dedent hop has none to spend — the same stop item 148 recorded. -/
