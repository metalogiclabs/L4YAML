/-! # The raised-flag refusal map (DOCS item 119)

The tightening's last prerequisite (items 110/116–118) reads: where
`documentEverStarted` is up and no suffix intervened, every input the
fallback `.bare` sites still serve must be scanner-refused.  This item
MEASURED that sentence instead of building on it, and the measurement
repriced it:

**The §9.2 refusal lives in the parser, not the scanner.**  Every family
below scans clean in BOTH pipelines and dies downstream in
`parseStreamLoop` (`StreamState.validNextToken`,
`Parser/TokenParser.lean`) or the emitters' twins — as
`invalidBareDocument`, "expected '---' or '...' before new document".
So the refusal half is a runtime MIGRATION — the scanner must learn the
check — and it decomposes into exactly three mechanisms, each validated
here against the runtime's own verdicts:

* **M1 — the completed root document** (§2): block context, the indent
  stack at its sentinel alone, the last real token a flow close or a
  scalar of any style, and a line break crossed since its end.  Placed
  after the structural dispatch, so `---`/`...`/directives stay legal.
  Same-line junk is already refused (`validateFlowClose`,
  `validateTrailingContent` — §5); a root plain scalar completes only
  where its walk stops (a comment line), and the alias-as-root case is
  unreachable (`undefinedAlias` fires first).
  **LANDED** as `scanNextToken_checkBareDocument` (item 132), so §2's pins
  are `scannerRefuses` now — `ScannerBareDocumentRefusal` carries the
  mechanism's own boundary.  The break condition is read off
  `simpleKeyAllowed` rather than off the completing token's position: a
  scalar's `endPos` is not populated, so a line test on the TOKEN reads a
  multi-line scalar's START.
* **M2 — the dangling node run at an open level's column** (§3): a
  trailing token run `[anchor|tag]* (scalar|alias)?` whose start sits at
  an open indent level's exact column, whose structural predecessor is
  NOT `.value`/`.key`/`.blockEntry`, with a break crossed (or EOF, in
  `scanLoop`).  The three exempt predecessors are the equal-column value
  readings the pipeline ACCEPTS — `a:⏎b` = `{a: b}`, `?⏎b⏎: v`,
  `-⏎b` — pinned in §6.
  **LANDED** as `scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode` and its EOF twin
  `scanLoop_checkDanglingNode` (item 133), so §3's pins are
  `scannerRefuses` now — `ScannerDanglingNodeRefusal` carries the
  mechanism's own boundary.  The exempt predecessors are
  `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`; the position reported is the RUN's start,
  which is where the parser reported.
* **M3 — the `-` at a mapping top's own column** (§4): valid iff a node
  is still awaited (the last real token, read past a `[96]` run, is one
  of `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`'s) or a same-indent sequence is
  continuing (a `.blockEntry` at this column stands before any
  `.key`/`.value` at a column ≤ it, walking the array BACKWARD);
  otherwise refused.  `?` and `:` at the column open new entries and
  stay legal (§6).  **LANDED** as `scanBlockEntryValidate` (item 134),
  so §4's pins are `scannerRefuses` now, and
  `ScannerBlockEntryMappingIndent` carries the mechanism's own boundary
  — including the family this map did NOT record, a `-` at the column of
  a mapping COMPACT IN A SEQUENCE ENTRY (`- a: 1⏎␣␣- y`), which both
  pipelines ACCEPTED and which the check also closes.

All three reuse `.invalidBareDocument`; on every probed input the
parser's message AND position are what the scanner check would produce,
so the migration is byte-invisible to the matrix and eventscore.  Item 132
confirmed that for M1 by running its condition over the whole suite before
editing the runtime: two tests reach it (BS4K, KS4U), both error tests,
both with the identical message and position.

**The price, measured (and why this landed as a map, not a build).**
The emitter-scannability trees re-verify the scanning of emitted output
through `scanNextToken`'s decomposition: the `scanNextToken_via_*`
composition lemmas have ~105 call sites across ~20 files in the two
trees, the `dispatchStructural`-shape facts ~145 references, and
`scanBlockEntry` 276 references.  Every placement of a new refusal —
a new bind in `scanNextToken`'s chain, a throw inside
`dispatchStructural`, or one inside `scanBlockEntry` — lands its
discharge burden on one of those ladders, a 100+-site absorption PER
MECHANISM.  So the refusal half is at least three items (one mechanism
plus its absorption each), not one, and this guard pins today's
verdicts so each landing flips its section loudly and intentionally.
M1's absorption, measured by building it and counting what the
compiler asked for: **41** extra `split`s across **24** files that
decompose `scanNextToken`/`scanNextTokenIx`, and **56** discharges across
**17** files on the `via_*` ladder — which cost one ARGUMENT each rather
than a proof, because those lemmas take the checks as premises and the
converse extractor reads the new one off an `.ok` witness the site
already holds.  So the "100+-site absorption per mechanism" above is the
right order of magnitude and the right shape; what it is not is 100 sites
of REASONING.  M2's (item 133) is 63 + 84, and the difference is the
PLACEMENT: a bind before the structural dispatch lands in the preprocess
arm of every chain decomposition, `scanLoop` included, while one after it
is reached through a single `split`.

§2–§4 pin what WAS the gap (`parserGap`: both scanners accept, both
pipelines refuse) and is now `scannerRefuses` throughout, the class
itself pinned empty at the end of §4; §5 the neighbors the scanner
already refused; §6 the valid boundary each mechanism must not cross. -/

anchored mapping.  M2's `.value` exemption therefore leaves it to the

parity holds; the LAYER differs).  The comma twin is symmetric.  M1's
landing inherits the indexed same-line boundary as its own obligation. -/
