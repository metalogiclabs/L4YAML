/-! # The anchored null key composes (DOCS item 49)

`&a : b` is a parked `[96] c-ns-properties` run read whole as the implicit
KEY: `[161] ns-flow-node`'s props-only alternative under `[193]
ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`, then `[189]`'s `:` and the parked value.  Item
48 refused the run's same-line `-`/`?` (no compact alternative behind
properties) and left the `:` as the family's one grammatical inhabitant;
item 49 composes it through `PropsKeyPack`'s entry route — no runtime
change, so every pin here is an ACCEPT pin, and what the item moves is the
derivation (the props park's `:` arm fires `colon_fires_props_key` instead
of the escape).

The pins fix the event shape — the run is ONE key node (`=VAL &a :`), not a
property attached to the value — at the root, under a mapping value, under a
sequence entry, with both halves, with an empty value, and with a sibling
entry continuing the mapping. -/
