/-! # The completed root document, refused at the scanner (DOCS item 132)

§9.2 `[211] l-yaml-stream` admits a bare document as the stream's first or after
a `...`, and nowhere else.  A ROOT node that is already complete, followed by
content on a LATER line with no marker between them, is a second bare document
and has no derivation.  Item 119 measured that the refusal lived in the PARSER
(`StreamState.validNextToken`) and named the migration M1; this is the landing.

`scanNextToken_checkBareDocument` runs after the structural dispatch — so
`---`, `...` and directives are reached first and stay legal — and asks three
questions of the state the dispatch is about to read:

* the indent stack is the sentinel alone, so the completed node is the
  DOCUMENT's rather than an entry inside a still-open block collection (the
  dangler at an open level's own column is M2's, and §5 keeps its pins);
* the last real token COMPLETES a node — `YamlToken.completesFlowValue`, the
  set `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency` already reads;
* `simpleKeyAllowed` is up.

**The third conjunct is the item's one measurement.**  "A break was crossed
since the node ended" cannot be read off the completing TOKEN: `endPos` is
populated only for the indicator tokens, so a scalar's is its own start, and a
multi-line scalar (`"a⏎b"`, `|⏎  x`) would compare as if it ended on its first
line.  The flag says it exactly: every completing scan clears
`simpleKeyAllowed` and only a line break re-arms it — which is the same reading
item 47's check makes with the flag DOWN, one dispatcher later.  §3's same-line
family is what the flag keeps out.

§1 types the check and its four passing shapes.  §2 is the refused family, by
root style and by landing kind.  §3 is the boundary — the same-line implicit
key, the plain scalar's own continuation, a property run, a marker, a comment.
§4 pins that the refusal is the SCANNER's and that its message and position are
what the parser produced.  §5 is what M1 does not reach. -/

/-! ## §1  The check, and the four ways it stands aside -/

/-- Inside a flow collection there is no document boundary to police. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (h : s.inFlow = true) :
    scanNextToken_checkBareDocument s = .ok () := by
  simp only [scanNextToken_checkBareDocument, h, Bool.not_true, Bool.false_and,
             Bool.false_eq_true, ↓reduceIte]

/-- Resting ON an open level the completed node is an ENTRY's, not the
    document's — M2's question, not this one.  Item 145 made this the check's
    first conjunct: a block collection merely being OPEN is not enough, because
    a landing right of every level (`k:⏎␣␣"x"⏎␣␣b: 2`) is refused here. -/
example (s : ScannerState)
    (h : (s.indents.any fun e => e.column == (s.col : Int)) = true) :
    scanNextToken_checkBareDocument s = .ok () := by
  simp only [scanNextToken_checkBareDocument, h, Bool.not_true, Bool.and_false,
             Bool.false_and, Bool.false_eq_true, ↓reduceIte]

/-- On the completed node's OWN line the flag is down — this is where the node
    is still readable as an implicit key. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (h : s.simpleKeyAllowed = false) :
    scanNextToken_checkBareDocument s = .ok () := by
  simp only [scanNextToken_checkBareDocument, h, Bool.and_false, Bool.false_and,
             Bool.false_eq_true, ↓reduceIte]

/-- …and with nothing completed behind the cursor there is no first document to
    have ended: properties, indicators and the markers are all excluded. -/
example (s : ScannerState)
    (h : ∀ t, lastRealTokenVal? s.tokens = some t → t.completesFlowValue = false) :
    scanNextToken_checkBareDocument s = .ok () := by
  unfold scanNextToken_checkBareDocument
  cases hx : lastRealTokenVal? s.tokens with
  | none => simp
  | some t => simp [h t hx]

/-- The positive shape, in full: all three conjuncts and the error is the
    parser's own, at the cursor. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (t : YamlToken)
    (h_flow : s.inFlow = false) (h_ska : s.simpleKeyAllowed = true)
    (h_ind : (s.indents.any fun e => e.column == (s.col : Int)) = false)
    (h_last : lastRealTokenVal? s.tokens = some t)
    (h_cmp : t.completesFlowValue = true) :
    scanNextToken_checkBareDocument s
      = .error (.invalidBareDocument s.line s.col) := by
  simp only [scanNextToken_checkBareDocument, h_flow, h_ska, h_ind, h_last, h_cmp,
             Bool.not_false, Bool.and_self, ↓reduceIte]

/-! ## §5  What M1 does not reach

    The discriminator between M1 and M2 is the indent stack: a dangler at an
    OPEN level's column has a level on it, so M1's check stands aside on every
    input below (§1's second shape).  M2 landed at item 133 and M3 at item 134,
    so all of them are the scanner's now — they stay here because they are what
    distinguishes the mechanisms, and §1's second shape is why M1 stands aside
    on every one. -/

-- M2: the dangling node at an open level's own column (item 133).
#guard scannerRefuses "a: 1\nb\n"
#guard scannerRefuses "- a\nb\n"
#guard scannerRefuses "---\na: 1\nb\n"
#guard scannerRefuses "k: [1, 2]\nb\n"
-- M3: the `-` at a mapping top's own column with the entry complete
-- (item 134) — the token behind it is an INDICATOR, not a node body, so M2
-- stands aside on these exactly as M1 does.
#guard scannerRefuses "a: 1\n- y\n"
#guard scannerRefuses "? k\n- y\n"
