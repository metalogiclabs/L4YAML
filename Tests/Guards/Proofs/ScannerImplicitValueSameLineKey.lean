/-! # The implicit value's stamp reaches its own content's park (DOCS item 101)

Item 65 named `KeyPackPunt.noFrame` for a key on the park's own line with no
`[185] s-l+block-indented` compact alternative to close, and its guard
(`ScannerKeyPackPunt` §4) pinned the two shapes the name covered side by side:
`? a⏎: b: c` ACCEPTED and `k: a: 1` REFUSED.  One name, two behaviors — so the
name was covering two reasons, and item 101 splits it.

The refused half is `[189]`'s IMPLICIT value.  Its slot is `s-l+block-node`,
which has no compact alternative, so the pack really has no frame there; but
the value indicator that opened the slot STAMPED its line
(`implicitValueLine`), and §8.2.2 refuses a second value indicator on a
stamped line — the same check item 48 spent at the value indicator's own park,
one step later.  So `KeyPackPunt.implicitValue` carries the stamp and the
park's stale tail, and `colon_fires_implicit_key` refutes instead of deferring.

What makes the stamp spendable is that it SURVIVES the value's own content:
`scanValue` is the field's only writer, so the scalar and alias scans between
the indicator and the park leave it alone
(`dispatchContent_implicitValueLine`, §4 below), and a break-free landing
keeps the park on the stamped line.

The accepted half keeps the name: an EXPLICIT `:`'s value has no slot to hand
over either, and `?⏎: b: c` is legal — that one wants the `?` frame's own
value pack, not a refutation.  §3 pins it, so the split is machine-checked in
both directions rather than asserted here. -/
