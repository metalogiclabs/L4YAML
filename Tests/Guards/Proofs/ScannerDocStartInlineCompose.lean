/-! # The explicit document's one-line body composes (DOCS item 43)

`--- a` is `[208] l-explicit-document`'s body taken as `[207] l-bare-document`
on the marker's own line: `[80] s-separate(0)`'s inline arm crosses the whites
after the `---`, the node reads at the top level, and `[79] s-l-comments`
closes it.  The park after a `---` is mid-line, so it cannot CLOSE first — the
route items 15–42 used everywhere else (close the pending at a landing, then
re-anchor) does not exist here — and the pending has carried its own closer
since the constructor was written: `h_doc_builder`'s `GAlt` left branch takes
exactly an `SLBareDocument` starting at the park.  Item 43 parameterizes the
content dispatch by that closer (`content_dispatch_routed`; the old
`content_dispatch_after_close` is its bare-document instance), and the branch
gets its FIRST consumer.

§1 pins the family: every content head the dispatch serves, at the marker —
plain, both quote styles, properties bare and valued, verbatim and shorthand
tags, both block scalars, tab separation, a trailing comment, the empty-node
`#c` form — and the closures behind it (a second document, a suffix, a
directive document, the multiline fold).  §2 pins the boundary the scanner
keeps: a block COLLECTION may not open on the marker's line (`[200]` puts
`s-l-comments` between `---` and a collection — `contentOnDocumentStartLine`,
scanner-accepted parser-refused, which is why the routed arm's key context
PUNTS and loses nothing: no implicit key ever fires behind this park), a
glued `---a`/`---#c` is no marker at all, and an alias at the root can never
resolve. -/

/-! ## §2  The boundary the scanner keeps

A block COLLECTION may not open on the marker's line: `[200]
s-l+block-collection` puts `s-l-comments` between a node's properties and the
collection, and the same reading holds at the document level.  The SCANNER
refuses the whole family (item 48: `sameLineBlockCollection` for `-`/`?`,
`contentOnDocumentStartLine` for a `:` behind the marker), which is the
reason the routed arm's key context punts without loss: no implicit key ever
fires behind a `---` park, spaced or not. -/
