/-! # `[96]`'s LENGTH, and the gate it pays for (DOCS item 165)

Item 164 left row 1c with one gate site unpaid and one guard unbuilt, and named
them in that order: `accum_flow_open_depth0`'s props arm, then
`pendingProps.h_route` taking `danglingNodePos? sc = none`.  Building the second
first is what showed the order was wrong — the guard does not relay through a
run's own EXTENSION, and item 160 had priced that class as free.

**What blocked it.**  `trailingNodeRun?` walks back over at most TWO properties,
because `[96] c-ns-properties` derives at most one anchor and one tag.  A third
property therefore MOVES §9.2's start — from the run's first property to its
second — so the park's reading and the reading one push later are readings of
different tokens (`PropsRunReadingTransport` §1 measures the move).

**What unblocks it is the scanner, not the proof.**  Both §6.9 guards decide by
KIND and, outside a flow, read `trailingPropertyRunOnLine` — the current LINE's
run.  That is blind to a run crossing a break: at the `&b` of `&a⏎!t &b x` the
line's run is `[!t]`, which carries no anchor, so the third property was
accepted and only `TokenParser` refused the document.  `propertyRunFull` decides
by LENGTH and reads the RUN, so the answer no longer depends on where the run's
breaks fall — and with the third property refused the walk-back never reaches
its cap at a park the scanner produces.

§1 measures the check, §2 the relay it buys, §3 the props arm's own gate — the
tenth and last of item 161's ten — and §4 the residue that leaves:
`ContentRouteGate`'s right disjunct, DELETED. -/

The third property is refused wherever the run's breaks fall, and both pipelines
agree.  Every input below was already `[96]`-invalid — two anchors or two tags
on one node — and `TokenParser` refused all four one stage later. -/

/-- The check, read back off a dispatch that succeeded — which is the form the
    accumulation spends: a park that took a third property had at most ONE
    trailing property, so the walk-back's cap is not reached. -/

/-! ## §2  The relay it buys

`pendingProps.h_route` takes `danglingNodePos? sc = none` now, so every step
that carries the run forward has to hand the verdict back.  Both relays split
the same way, and the split is the LANDING's: a step that crossed a break has
already been refused by §9.2's own mid-stream check
(`scanNextToken_checkDanglingNode` reads the run at the park and the flag at the
landing), and a step that crossed none wrote neither a token nor an indent — the
park's own two DOWN flags are what make that total. -/

/-! ## §3  The props arm's own gate — item 161's tenth site

The arm does not open at ONE verdict.  Which park the gate names is the
LANDING's to decide, and the two cases pay differently: a landing that crossed a
break owes the route unconditionally (§9.2's check already fired ON the park), so
the frame opens at `none` and `GateOf none` is `True` by definition; a landing
that crossed none leaves `sc` itself as the state the bracket extends, so the
frame opens at `some sc` and the close hands the park's verdict straight back.

That is why no transport across preprocessing is needed: the arm where the two
states differ is the arm where the gate is not wanted. -/

example {sc s_prep s' : ScannerState} {sp_scan : SurfPos} {c : Char}
    {p : Positioned YamlToken}
    (h_corr : ScannerSurfCorr sc sp_scan)
    (h_pre : scanNextToken_preprocess sc = .ok (some (s_prep, c)))

/-! ## §4  The residue, deleted

`ContentRouteGate` was `danglingNodePos? s' = none ∨ (c = '&' ∨ c = '!')`, and
item 158 measured what the right disjunct named: not two characters but a
missing FIELD — `pendingProps` carried no §9.2 face, so at `&`/`!` the landing
had no reading to hand over.  It has one now, so the gate is the reading, for
every content character alike. -/
