# What a changed SUPPLIER propagates (DOCS item 240)

Item 238 measured what a deleted CONSTRUCTOR propagates and found `S=0`: no
consumer's STATEMENT names `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop`, so nothing above it
breaks on the deletion alone.  A consumer depends on its supplier's TYPE, and
proof irrelevance makes that exact.  β.5's repair, though, does not travel that
edge.  Item 239 proved `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` FALSE in the environment
that deletes the arm and keeps `PendingNode.pendingFlow`, so β.5 must change a
SUPPLIER'S STATEMENT — and what a changed statement propagates is a different
question, asked here.

## The number is a CHOICE, and this file measures the choice rather than the number

There are three repairs, and they are not variants of one edit:

| repair | the edit | `close_with_ssl`'s TYPE | the flip breaks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **weak** | `close_with_ssl` gains `(h_scan : SLYamlStream sp_start sp_scan)` and its flow arm closes with it | **CHANGES** | **5** |
| **field** | `pendingFlow` gains the same connection as its LAST field | unchanged | **1** |
| **retire** | `pendingFlow` deleted, docstring and arm together | unchanged | **7** |

`scripts/flip_supplier.py` runs all three for real, and a fourth end threads
the `field` repair one level to measure its second wave (DOCS item 241).
Each end leaves a well-typed, DROP-FREE supplier behind, and each prints
`REPAIRED errors=0` so that "the repair elaborates" is a reading and not a
silence.  **The three counts travel three different edges and are not a
ratio.**

**Only the weak repair changes a consumer's TYPE, and it changes nineteen of
them.**  §2 walks `close_with_ssl`'s reverse closure: 19 declarations in eight
rings, ending at both of the capstones the arm reaches and at
`L4YAML.Surface.parse_strict` / `scan_strict`.  Every one of the 19 is inside
item 238's transitive set — `thread \ T` is EMPTY — so the thread does not add
a reproof to β.5's bill; it decides how many of the bill's items are
restatements rather than reproofs.  The answer to item 239's question is
therefore **19 under the weak repair and 0 under the other two**.

That question is about `close_with_ssl`'s consumers, so the zero is exact and
narrow.  **It is not a claim that the other two repairs change no statements.**
The `field` end moves the connection to the park's PRODUCER, which cannot
derive it from the correspondence it holds, so a premise is threaded there
instead and the producer's own closure is eighteen declarations — seven of
them outside item 238's set, which the weak repair never leaves:
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ProducerDerivation.lean` (DOCS item 241).

## Why the thread does not stop before the top

§1 proves the two halves that make the weak repair a RELOCATION rather than a
discharge.  `nd_ssl_extend` is the repaired flow arm in the post-β.5 model: a
stream reaching `sp_scan` closes the park across `[79] s-l-comments` with no
escape.  `park_gives_no_scan` refutes the premise's other source: the park
cannot produce that stream, so it has to come from the consumer.

§3 then asks each of the 19 whether it already holds one.  Seven carry a
`PendingNode` hypothesis at all, and **none of the seven carries a stream to
that park's scan position** — so the premise has nowhere to land short of the
top.  The other twelve do not mention a park, which is a stronger form of the
same answer.  This is a census of what the statements HOLD; whether some
statement could DERIVE the datum from its other premises is not decided here,
and §1 decides it only for the park.

## Where this meets item 239

Ten of the twenty-six conclude at `chars = []`, and the suffix law is silent
about such a target because `[]` is a suffix of every input — which is why item
239 could refute six of the twenty-six and not decide the other twenty.  **Nine
of those ten are on this thread.**  The statements no law can force to change
are exactly the ones a premise would have to travel through, so the two
measurements meet at one population rather than overlapping by accident.  §4
pins `empty=10 onThread=9`; the tenth is `inYamlLanguage_everything`, which no
proof in the library derives through the park.

## Which instrument dominates depends on the edge

Item 238 found the environment walk strictly dominating the flip, and for a
constructor's DELETION that still holds.  For its ARMS the ordering inverts:
the walk cannot answer, and §4 pins why.

* the walk reads **10** declarations naming `pendingFlow` in a proof term;
* the flip reports **7**.

Three names differ and each for its own reason.  `close_with_ssl` case-splits
on the park and the `retire` repair deletes its arm with the constructor, so it
does not break.  `accum_structural_pending` case-splits on the `true`-indexed
park, where `pendingFlow` cannot occur, and the flip shows it SURVIVES the
deletion.  `Tests.Guards.DropFalsity.flowPark` builds the park for real and
would break; the flip never sees it, because the build stops at the first
failing module and that module is `StreamAccum`.

**Two refinements of the walk were tried and both read 10.**  Reading raw
references one step, with no generated auxiliary inlined, reads 10; counting
the park's largest application arity reads 8 — a FULL application — for all
ten.  A case split on an indexed family builds its own constructor terms, for
the impossible arms as much as for the reachable ones, so no syntactic reading
of a proof term separates a builder from a case-splitter.  That is item 238's
`SLYamlStream.rec` lesson one level down, and it is why the flip is not
optional here.  §4 pins all three readings at 10 so that a future refinement
which DOES separate them disagrees with this file loudly.

/-! ## §1 The premise the weak repair adds, and where it cannot come from -/

/-- **The repaired flow arm, in the post-β.5 model.**  `close_with_ssl`'s
    `pendingFlow` case is the one place in the library that spends the escape
    on a park; given a stream that already reaches `sp_scan`, the case closes
    through `[202] l-document-prefix`'s comment alternative and needs no
    escape.  This is `ssl_comments_extend_stream`'s proof, transported to the
    relation β.5 leaves behind — so the weak repair is a repair, not a hope. -/

    StreamND a c :=
  StreamND.implicitContinue a b c c c h

      (SLDocumentPrefix.comments b c (SSLComments_to_GStar b c h_ssl))
      (GStar.nil _))
    (GOpt.none _) (GStar.nil _)

/-- **And the park cannot supply it.**  The premise `nd_ssl_extend` consumes is
    not derivable from `PendingNode sc false sp_start sp_block sp_scan` plus a
    stream to `sp_block`: item 239's witness parks at `⟨['a'], 0⟩` with the
    scanner at `⟨['b','b','b'], 0⟩`, and the model's suffix law refutes the
    conclusion.  So the weak repair RELOCATES one obligation from the supplier
    to its consumers; §3 measures where it lands. -/

    Reported as a triple so the denominator is visible: a declaration with no
    park hypothesis scores `covered = false` for a reason that has nothing to
    do with the repair, and merging the two would report a rate over the wrong
