/-! # `-⏎  a: 1` — the mapping NESTED under a block entry (DOCS item 40)

Item 38 gave `ImplicitKeyPack` a route instead of one producer's coordinates and
spent it on the compact entry (`- a: 1`); item 39 spent it again on the mapping
that is the VALUE of a `[189]` entry (`k:⏎  a: 1`).  Both producers read the same
characters with the same lemma and differed only in the branch of the landing
they took — one stayed on the line, one crossed a break — so item 40 merges them
into `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`, and the merge is what closes this file's family:
a `-`-parked pending now has the break-crossed frame too, which is `[185]
s-l+block-indented`'s block-node alternative with `[187] l+block-mapping`
auto-detected at the landing's width (`valueMapRoute` over `nestedBlockMap`,
item 39's lemma unchanged).

The second half is item 39's own boundary, re-cut.  `nestedBlockMap`'s side
condition `n ≤ k` is a statement about the LANDING, not about the arm: both
numbers are in hand where the pack is built, so the producer decides per input
and only a DEDENT defers.  Item 39 read it as a property of
`accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented` and left that arm punting whole;
§3 pins what it was punting.

§1 the family itself.  §2 composing.  §3 the indented value pending, re-opened,
with the dedents that genuinely defer.  §4 what still punts and the boundary the
scanner keeps.

/-! ## §1  The mapping nested under a `-`

The `-` parks the entry, the step crosses a break to column 0, and `[63]
s-indent(w)` walks to the key.  What the pending awaits is `[185]`'s
`s-l+block-node(n, block-in)`, so the landing is `[199] s-l+block-collection`'s
own `s-l-comments` and the mapping's width is auto-detected at `w` — the same
reading item 39 gave the mapping VALUE, under a different frame. -/

/-! ## §2  Composing

Siblings at the nested width, a second level, the sibling ENTRY of the enclosing
sequence, the landing's own comment and blank lines, and the two nestings that
put this frame under another entry.  The block scalars are the floor conjunct's
shapes: crossing a break to a known zero is what lets `[63]`'s width be
measured, so the pack carries the entry's index here where item 38's compact
route had to punt it. -/

/-! ## §3  Item 39's boundary, re-cut

`accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented` was left punting whole because a
landing THERE may be a dedent.  It may also not be: `n ≤ k` is decidable where
the pack is built, so the arm now serves every landing that nests.  The last two
are the dedents, which still take the deferral — they are pinned as ACCEPTED,
because the boundary is about which derivation the accumulation can name, not
about what the runtime does. -/

/-! ## §4  What still punts, and the boundary the scanner keeps

The `&`/`!` head was item 17's pack, still carrying the coordinates
`ImplicitKeyPack` shed — item 41 gave it the same route and the first two pins
below now COMPOSE (`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ScannerEntryPropsKey.lean`); they stay
here because the emitted events are the same either way and this file's family is
where the head was first named.  A closed FLOW node is `FlowOpenStack`'s resume
type; and `[186]`'s explicit entry is an opener, not a key the content dispatch
parked.  Below them is what the scanner decides before any of it is asked. -/
