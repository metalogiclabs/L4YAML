/-! # The `,` ends the explicit-key entry (DOCS item 9l)

Items 9g and 9j pinned the flow `?`'s two *character* neighbours — what may
stand before it, and that a separation must follow.  This pins its *entry*
boundary, and it turned out to be wrong on both layers at once.

## The scanner half

`scanKey` records `explicitKeyLine := some line` so that content on the `?`'s
line reads as the explicit key's own node rather than as a fresh implicit key —
the guard in `saveSimpleKey` and branch (1) of `scanValueClearKey`.  That scope
is the ENTRY, not the line:

    [150] ns-flow-pair(n,c) ::= ( "?" s-separate(n,c)
                                   ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) )
                              | ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c)

is ONE `ns-flow-seq-entry`, and `[138]`/`[141]`'s `","` starts the next one.
Leaving the line set made every later entry on that line unable to reserve a
simple key, so the retroactive `.key` token was never written — and
`parseFlowSequenceLoop` dispatches on exactly that token.  The result was a
shipped **over-rejection**:

    [? a, b: c]        [? a, : b]        [? a, : ]        [? a,⏎: b]

all valid, all handled correctly one collection kind over (the flow-MAPPING
parser does not need the marker), all rejected with `expected ']' but reached
end of tokens`.  `scanFlowEntry` now clears `explicitKeyLine`; §1 pins the
repair and §3 pins what the repair must not break.

## The grammar half

The same boundary is missing from the surface grammar, in the opposite
direction — it is too NARROW where the scanner was too broad.  Every `?`-headed
constructor of `SFlowSeqEntry`/`SFlowMapEntry` demanded an `SFlowNode` key, but

    [143] ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) ::= ns-flow-map-implicit-entry(n,c)
                                            | ( e-node /* Key */
                                                e-node /* Value */ )

has an arm with no key at all, and `[151] ns-flow-pair-entry`'s
`c-ns-flow-map-empty-key-entry` [146] has an empty key with a `:`.  So `[? ]`,
`{? }`, `[? , a]`, `[: a]` and `[:]` parse — correctly, and have done all
along — with no derivation to point at.  §4 pins the shapes the three new
constructors (`explicitPairEmptyNodes`, `emptyKeyValue`, `emptyKeyEmpty` on the
sequence side; `explicitEmptyNodes` on the mapping side) exist to derive.

Nothing here is pinned as a rejection except §5, which re-checks that repairing
the boundary did not re-open item 9j.

Every one of these was `expected ']' but reached end of tokens` before item 9l.

/-! ## §2  What always worked, unchanged

The flow MAPPING never showed the defect — `parseFlowMappingLoop` reads a
missing `.key` as an empty key — which is why the sequence twin went unnoticed.
An explicit entry that CONSUMES its `:` was fine too, because `scanValue` clears
`explicitKeyLine` itself. -/

/-! ## §3  What clearing at the `,` must not break

`explicitKeyLine` also serves the BLOCK explicit key, and a block key's node may
be a flow collection whose commas run through `scanFlowEntry`.  Those commas
belong to the NESTED collection, and the block `:` on the following line
resolves through the indent stack rather than through `explicitKeyLine` — so
clearing is invisible to it. -/

#guard emits "? [a, b]\n: v\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP", "+SEQ []", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :b", "-SEQ",
   "=VAL :v", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :1", "=VAL :b",
   "=VAL :2", "-MAP", "=VAL :v", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

-- The ordinary block explicit key, with no flow anywhere.
#guard emits "? a\n: b\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :b", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

-- A block explicit key on ONE line: `:` on the `?`'s line is the value
-- indicator of a nested implicit key, so the explicit key is the COMPACT
-- mapping `{[a, b]: v}` and the entry's own value is empty (§8.2.2 [196]).
-- The pair below is the point — the comma-free twin has the same shape, so a
-- `,` inside the key's node does not change how the trailing `:` is read.
#guard emits "? [a] : v\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP", "+MAP", "+SEQ []", "=VAL :a", "-SEQ", "=VAL :v",

/-! ## §4  The shapes the new grammar constructors derive

These have parsed correctly all along; what they did not have was a derivation.
`[143]`'s `( e-node e-node )` arm is `explicitPairEmptyNodes` /
`explicitEmptyNodes`; `[146]`'s empty key is the sequence-side `emptyKeyValue` /
`emptyKeyEmpty`, whose mapping twins were already there. -/

-- `( e-node e-node )`: the explicit entry with no key and no value.

   "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §5  Item 9j is still closed

The repair is about the `,` AFTER the entry, not about the separation the `?`
demands.  A `?` with a flow indicator directly after it is still rejected. -/
