# How many proofs β.5 must redo (DOCS item 238)

Row 12's β.5 deletes `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop`.  Three numbers about that arm
were already measured and none of them is its repair bill: it is **two**
textual construction sites (row 12), **one** arm of 167 whose premises leave
the conclusion's target unconnected (item 236), and the sole support of
**fifteen** statements that are true without their hypotheses (item 237).

This file reads the bill off the elaborated environment.  Over the whole tree —
847 modules composed in one environment and the 36 executable entry points
probed one at a time, `scripts/drop_sweep.py` — the arm has

    D=4 direct  S=0 in a statement  R=0 case splits  T=26 transitive

and the transitive set ends at exactly two of the 25 capstones.

## The four populations, and why they must not be merged

**D** names the constructor in its PROOF TERM; **S** names it in its TYPE; **R**
case-splits over `SLYamlStream`, which breaks on an arity change without ever
building the arm; **T** is D closed upward through proof terms.

A walk that reads all four as one number reports the wrong one twice over.
`SLYamlStream.rec`'s own type names every constructor, so a walk that expands
into eliminators reads every case split as a construction — §2 pins that the
recursor's type does carry `scannerDrop`, which is why this census treats
eliminators as terminal and generated `match_`/`proof_`/`eq_` auxiliaries as
transparent.

## T is not the bill

**A theorem's consumers depend on its TYPE, not on its proof.**  Lean's
definitional proof irrelevance (§3) is what makes that exact rather than
approximate: if a supplier keeps its statement and only its proof is redone,
nothing above it is touched.  `S=0` says no consumer's statement names the arm,
so nothing in T breaks on the deletion alone.

The bill is therefore **4 at its floor and 26 at its ceiling**, and which end it
lands on is decided by two statements, not by the graph:

- `dropClose` concludes `SLYamlStream sp_start sp_m` for a `sp_m` its premises
  never reach, so it is the arm restated and cannot survive the deletion.  Its
  one consumer is `accum_flow_open_depth0`.
- `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` is restrictive in its `PendingNode` premise.  Its
  five consumers are `accum_block_pending`, `accum_content_pending`,
  `accum_flow_open_depth0`, `accum_structural_pending` and `eof_pending`.

Whether a statement is reprovable is not a graph property, and this file does
not claim to decide it — the same boundary item 237 drew around its fifteen.
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/DropFalsity.lean` (DOCS item 239) decides it for both of
the two by building the post-β.5 relation and refuting them in it: the
`PendingNode` premise is restrictive in the scanner state and in nothing that
connects `sp_block` to `sp_scan`, so `close_with_ssl` cannot be reproved
either.  **Both are restatements; the other twenty-four are reproofs.**

**How many of the twenty-four are ONLY reproofs is decided by the repair, and
not by this graph either.**  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/RepairChoice.lean` (DOCS item
240) reverses these same edges from `close_with_ssl`: repairing it with a
premise that connects the park's two positions changes NINETEEN statements —
its whole reverse closure, every one of them already inside `T` — while the two
repairs that leave its type alone change none.  That walk also brackets this
one rather than extending it.  For the park's own deletion the environment
reads ten users where the flip breaks seven, and neither one-step references
nor application arity separates a constructor's builders from the case splits
that eliminate it, so there the flip is not optional.

## What the cheap instrument buys over the expensive one

`scripts/flip_drop.py` deletes the arm for real and counts what stops
compiling.  Both construction sites are in one module that the library root
imports, so the build stops there and reports **2** — it cannot see the other
two, and it cannot see the 24 behind them.  Here the environment walk strictly
dominates the flip, which inverts this row's usual ordering; the flip is kept
because it is the only one of the two that checks the deletion elaborates.

/-! ## §1 The closure this file reads

Item 237's census read 109 of 230 modules before it imported the library root,
and reported a library.  This one pins its own closure first, and
`scripts/drop_sweep.py` re-runs the same `census` over every module in the tree
that has an olean — 847 composed in one environment, plus the 36 executable
entry points probed alone, because two root-namespace `main`s cannot share an
environment.  **The four counts are identical at every closure tried**; the
pins below are what makes that checkable rather than asserted. -/

/-- The modules of this library and its tests that this file's own imports
    reach: the library complete at 231, plus the two `Tests.Guards` modules that
    hold the Tests-side half of the first ring. -/
def expectedClosure : Nat := 233

/-- `scripts/drop_sweep.py`'s reading, re-derivable in one command and pinned
    here so that a walk which starts from the wrong root disagrees with it
    loudly.  The 36 entry points hold 602 declarations between them and
    reference the arm zero times.

    `readable` is the count that keeps the other numbers honest.  **A probe
    that fails contributes zero, and a zero is indistinguishable from a clean
    module**, so the sweep counts the readings it actually got and names every
    module it could not read.  Two failed when the counter was added, for
    reasons that have nothing in common: `Tests.QueryResults` does not reach
    `Lean.Elab.Command` transitively and the probe's own `run_cmd` would not
    elaborate, and `Tests.LimitTests.Runner` is a `lean_exe` that is not a
    DEFAULT target, so `lake build` never refreshed it and its olean was still
    the one Lean 4.32.0 wrote.  The sweep now imports the command elaborator
    and builds a target by name before giving up on it.

    One module in the tree stays UNMEASURED and the sweep says so:
    `Tests.ContentEqRefl` belongs to no Lake target at all, so nothing can
    elaborate it.  Reading its source finds no mention of the stream, which is
    a hint and not a check — item 237's own finding is that a statement can
    assert `InYamlLanguage` without naming it. -/
def expectedWide : String :=
  "closure=851 imported=847 excluded=36 readable=36 unreadable=0 \
excludedDecls=602 excludedDropRefs=0"

/-- **The four counts the WHOLE TREE reads, which are not the four this file's
    own `run_cmd` reads.**  `census` filters by `inScope`, which reads a
    declaration's MODULE — and a declaration being elaborated has none, so a
    census is blind to its own module.  It is equally blind to any module that
    does not import it.  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/DropFalsity.lean` (DOCS item 239)
    holds one exhibit that rides the arm on purpose, so the tree composed in
    one environment reads `T=27` where §2 reads `T=26`.  Both are pinned, and
    the difference is the instrument counting itself.
    `Tests/Guards/Proofs/RepairChoice.lean` (DOCS item 240),
    `Tests/Guards/Proofs/ProducerDerivation.lean` (DOCS item 241) and
    `Tests/Guards/Proofs/DispatchPrice.lean` (DOCS item 242) and
    `Tests/Guards/Proofs/ParkGapCensus.lean` (DOCS item 243) and
    `Tests/Guards/Proofs/ParkGapWidth.lean` (DOCS item 244) all join the tree
    without moving `T`: they reverse these edges, census the statements, refute
    a premise, derive the escape's CONNECTED form, read every site that
    spends it and measure how wide the gap at those sites is, and none of that
    builds the arm — items 242, 243 and 244 all pin `drop=false` for exactly
    that reason.  Item 243 reads `D`'s four proof terms under their binders
    rather than their statements, which is what makes `expectedDirect` below
    the population of a census rather than a list; item 244 reads the PARK's
    producer the same way, one ring outside `D`. -/

    defect.  `stream_anything` is item 236's free-maker and item 235 restates it;

/-! ## §4 What this file does NOT establish and what it does not carry

The axiom probe reads three theorems here.  All three are `structure Census`'s
generated `mk.injEq`, `mk.inj` and `mk.sizeOf_spec`; this file authors none,
because its exhibits are `example`s (item 229's rule) and its claim is carried
by the pins rather than by a statement it could get wrong twice.

It does not establish that the 24 behind the first ring must be edited.  They
must be edited exactly when a statement below them changes, and only two
statements are candidates — `dropClose`, which goes, and
`PendingNode.close_with_ssl`, which may not.  Deciding the second is β.5's
work, not a census's; what this file fixes is that the question is about two
declarations rather than about twenty-six. -/
