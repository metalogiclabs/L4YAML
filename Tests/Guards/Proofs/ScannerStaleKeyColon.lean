/-! # The key from an EARLIER line is not this `:`'s key (DOCS item 104)

`colon_fires_implicit_key` asks two decidable questions of the park before it
does anything: is a simple key live, and is it on the park's own line.  The
second had no answer — a live key on an earlier line rode the deferral — and
item 103 recorded the family that lands there as `flowKeyPack_of_close`'s
residue, reading it as the HEAD's `∨ True`.  That reading was wrong about which
punt the input reaches: `[1,⏎ 2]: 3` never gets as far as the pack, because the
pack's own guard is the question above and it is FALSE there.

The answer is §7.4's own check.  `[154] ns-s-implicit-yaml-key` is one line and
`scanValueValidate` says so, throwing `invalidImplicitKey` when the `:` would
resolve a key saved on a different line — so a stale key at the park is an
input the scanner REFUSES, and the branch is a refutation rather than a
deferral.  The transport is item 48's verbatim (`dispatch_refutes_sameLine`'s
shape): the no-break payload carries the key, the line and the cursor to the
dispatch state, and the dispatch's own success contradicts them.

What the refutation does not decide is the one shape §7.4 hands on to §8.2.2
`[197]`: a `?` frame open on the key's own line takes the key down before §7.4
reads it (`scanValueClearKey`), and the misindent check decides the `:`
instead — but only when the `:` stands at the mapping's own indent.  §3 below
measures that pair and finds it empty: the explicit key's continuation lines
must be indented past the `?`, so the `:` that follows them never lands at the
`?`'s column, and the runtime says so with the column pair in its own message. -/
