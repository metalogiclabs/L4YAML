/-! # The landed `[96]` run reads at the entry's index (DOCS item 57)

A property run on the line BELOW its indicator (`k:⏎  -⏎    &a x`) is the same
single-half run the inline step reads — it has no occurrence of the index to
lift — and item 52's separator supplies the rest at the pending's own `n`.  The
one thing the break costs is the indent STABILITY: preprocessing unwinds the
stack on a fresh line, so the run's pending inherits no floor and the
consumer's transport punts, which costs the run nothing it uses here.

ZERO runtime edits; every pin is an ACCEPT pin. -/
