/-! # The flow collection carries the stamp to its own close (DOCS item 103)

Items 101 and 102 refuted the `[189]` implicit value's frameless key at the
park its CONTENT makes (`k: a: 1`) and at the park a `[96]` PROPERTY RUN makes
(`k: &p a: 1`).  The third park in that slot is a closed flow collection, and
it kept deferring: `flowKeyPack_of_close` punted `noKeyContext` — the reason
that is about the CALLER and carries nothing — wherever item 56's frame had no
key route to hand.

What was missing is a TRANSPORT, and a long one.  The park a `]` makes is not
one step past the value indicator but a whole collection past it, and the datum
the refutation needs is a scanner field read at the close.  `scanValue` is
`implicitValueLine`'s only writer and it declines inside a flow (`[142]`'s `:`
is not `[194]`'s), so the field the open was dispatched under IS the field the
close is dispatched under — and `KmSound`'s base slot, which already carries
the open's key COLUMN across the interior (item 75), carries its stamp reading
with it.  The open records it by a `by_cases` on the saved key's own line, and
the close spends it: `k: [1]: 2` is refused for exactly the reason `k: a: 1`
is, one construct over. -/
