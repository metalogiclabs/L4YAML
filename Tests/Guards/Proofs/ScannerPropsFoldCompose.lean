/-! # The props-decorated fold reads at the run's route index (DOCS item 55)

The last fold shape: a held `[96]` run at an INDENTED route (`k+1`) whose
decorated value crosses a line — `k:⏎  - &a "x⏎     y"`.  The props
consumer's one-question lemma gains a fourth answer (the fixed-index content
at `k+1`, items 53/54's readings fired off the pending's inherited floor),
and its consumer is the first arm's park with `SFlowNode.propsContent` at
the route index.  ZERO runtime edits; all pins ACCEPT. -/
