/-! # What the entry key pack punts on, and where each one is answered (DOCS item 65)

`entryKeyPack_of_dispatch` used to hand `True` for every shape it could not
read back as `[193]`/`[194]`'s implicit key, so the `:` step that consumes the
pack could not tell one from another and deferred on all of them.  Item 65
replaces that `True` with `KeyPackPunt`'s five named reasons and spends the one
that is the `:`'s own.  Everything below is RUNTIME behavior — none of it
changed at this item; the pins say what the proof's new case split has to be
consistent with.  They pin the SHAPES the reasons name and how the scanner
answers them, not which arm a given input takes: an escape is silent, so no
runtime observation can say that.

* §1 **the tab is the `:`'s to refuse, not preprocessing's.**  A tab in the
  whitespace in front of a KEY sits past `currentIndent`, so §6.1's
  preprocessing gate lets it through and the same run reads fine in front of a
  VALUE.  What refuses `k:⏎␣→a: 1` is `scanValueIndentTabCheck`, one step
  later, walking back from `simpleKey.pos` — which is exactly the reading
  `KeyPackPunt.tab` carries.  The error's own line and column name the KEY, not
  the `:`.
* §2 **and the tab in front of a `:` is legal**, because `[154]`'s trailing
  `s-separate-in-line?` admits `s-white`: only the run in front of the ENTRY is
  `[63] s-indent`.  This is the boundary the refutation must not cross.
* §3 **the key HEAD was never what was missing.**  A block scalar is a node and
  never a key, and the scanner says so by clearing the saved key — the `:` after
  `k: |⏎  x` opens a SECOND entry with an empty key rather than resolving the
  scalar.  An alias IS a key wherever a park offers one.
* §4 **the reasons that remain are claims, not formalities.**  `dedent` and
  ~~`noFrame`~~ each name a shape the scanner ACCEPTS, so the deferral they ride
  is carrying real inputs — row 19's frame stack and item 51's explicit-entry
  threading respectively.  (`noFrame`'s shape is `- ? a: b`, not the
  `? a⏎: b: c` pinned below — item 105's correction; the landed `:` pays its
  own slot and the COMPACT `?` was the one that did not.)
  **Half of `noFrame` did not** — struck 2026-09-06 by
  item 101, which read the two pins below against each other: `? a⏎: b: c` is
  accepted and `k: a: 1` is refused, so one name was covering two reasons.  The
  refused half is `[189]`'s IMPLICIT value, whose indicator stamped its line;
  it is now `KeyPackPunt.implicitValue` and it is REFUTED at the same place the
  tab is.  See `ScannerImplicitValueSameLineKey`.  **And half of `noKeyContext`
  did not either** — struck 2026-09-06 by item 103, which read the same pair one
  construct over: `k: [1]: 2` is refused where `[1]: 2` is accepted, so a flow
  close in a stamped value slot was riding the CALLER's name for the INPUT's
  reason.  It hands `implicitValue` now, carried across the whole collection on
  the mask's base slot; see `ScannerFlowCloseSameLineKey`.  What keeps the name
  is a frame with no route at all, and its complement is what is pinnable: where
  item 56's frame does carry a route, the closed flow collection reads as
  `[194]`'s JSON key. -/
