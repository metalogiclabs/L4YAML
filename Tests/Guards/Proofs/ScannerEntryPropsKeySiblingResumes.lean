/-! # An entry-parked props key keeps its context's frames (DOCS item 115)

Item 111 gave `PropsKeyPack` the two resume twins and paid them at the
LANDING producer (`h_props_key`); the ENTRY producer —
`entryPropsKeyPack_of_dispatch`, the pack a parked block entry hands the run
it just scanned — still punted both, and had no dedent branch at all.  So
inside a still-open construct the props-headed key dropped its levels at the
`:`: `?⏎  &p a: b⏎  c: d⏎: - w`'s `c` could be given only as a fresh `[187]`
under a second bare document, and `k:⏎  a:⏎&p b: 2` deferred where its
implicit twin (item 99) had popped for two items already.

**The build is `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`'s four threaded premises (items
99/108), transposed verbatim.**  The lemma gains `h_nodeF`/`h_dframes` (the
stream-bottomed pair) and `h_nodeFV`/`h_dframesV` (the value-line-bottomed
pair, item 108's); the LANDED branch pays the pack's twins from the
node-domain pair whenever the landing is strictly deeper (`n < w` — at
`w = n` the sibling belongs to the level itself); the DEDENT branch pops the
comment-domain pair exactly as the implicit twin's does.  The six callers pay
what their parks hold: the mapping-value producers hand their own
`h_closeF99`/`h_frames99`/`h_closeFV*`/`h_framesV*`, the indented sequence
producer folds its entry into `h_closeF_old` with a nil tail, and the root
sequence producers punt all four as refusals.  No consumer changes:
`colon_open_map_props` has spent whatever rides since item 111.

§1 is the family at the runtime; §2–§3 are the payment and the pop at their
types; §4 is what this item does not close. -/

/-! ## §2 The landed payment: the nested mapping chains onto the frames

Items 99/108's terms verbatim — the run-headed entry and its tail close the
mapping the caller's node awaits (`nestedBlockMap` over the compact tail),
and the caller's frames carry on below it.  The strictly-deeper landing
re-bounds the stack under `w`, which is the pack's own side condition. -/

example {sp_start sp_scan sp_mid sp_prep : SurfPos} {n w : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (hnw : n ≤ w) (hlt : n < w)
    (h_ssl : SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid)
    (h_ind : SIndent w sp_mid sp_prep)
    (h_le : ∀ k' ∈ ks, k' ≤ n)
    (nodeF : ∀ sp_m : SurfPos, SBlockNode n .blockIn sp_scan sp_m →
      ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_m) :
    (∀ k' ∈ ks, k' < w) ∧
    (∀ sp_v : SurfPos, SBlockMapEntry w sp_prep sp_v →
     ∀ sp_e : SurfPos, SCompactMapTail w sp_v sp_e →
     ResumeFrames (SLYamlStream sp_start) ks sp_e) :=
  ⟨fun k' hk' => Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (h_le k' hk') hlt,
   fun _sp_v h_entry sp_e h_tail =>
     nodeF sp_e (nestedBlockMap hnw h_ssl
       (SBlockMapEntries_of_compactTail h_ind h_entry h_tail))⟩

/-! ## §3 The dedent pop: one polymorphic spend serves both stacks

Item 108's parameterized bottom is what makes the transposition one term:
the pop below is stated over any `P`, so instantiating it at
`SLYamlStream sp_start` gives the pack's route and stream twin, and at
`ExplValueLine sp_start nv` its value-line twin — the two `match`es in the
lemma's dedent branch are this example twice. -/

example {P : SurfPos → Prop} {sp_scan sp_mid sp_prep : SurfPos}
    {w : Nat} {ks : List Nat}
    (hmem : w ∈ ks)
    (h_ssl : SSLComments sp_scan sp_mid)
    (h_ind : SIndent w sp_mid sp_prep)

      ResumeFrames P ks sp_m) :
    (∀ sp_v, SBlockMapEntry w sp_prep sp_v → P sp_v) ∧
    ∃ ks' : List Nat, (∀ k' ∈ ks', k' < w) ∧
      ∀ sp_v : SurfPos, SBlockMapEntry w sp_prep sp_v →
      ∀ sp_e : SurfPos, SCompactMapTail w sp_v sp_e →
      ResumeFrames P ks' sp_e := by
  obtain ⟨ks', h_w', cont'⟩ := (dframes sp_mid h_ssl).resumeAt hmem
  exact ⟨fun sp_v h_entry =>
    (cont' sp_v (SCompactMapTail.cons w sp_mid sp_prep sp_v sp_v
      h_ind h_entry (SCompactMapTail.nil w sp_v))).close,
    ks', h_w'.lt, fun sp_v h_entry sp_e h_tail =>
      cont' sp_e (SCompactMapTail.cons w sp_mid sp_prep sp_v sp_e
        h_ind h_entry h_tail)⟩

/-! ## §4 What this item does NOT close

* The COMPACT branch's twins — item 99's residue, shared with
  `entryKeyPack_of_dispatch`'s compact branch on both packs: the frame's
  levels are fused into the enclosing entry's closure, so
  `? - &p a: b⏎...`'s compact key still hands `Or.inr trivial` twice.
* The sequence SIBLING after a landed nesting (`k:⏎  -⏎    &p b: c⏎  - y`,
  §1's runtime pin): a `-` landing is not a key, so it is outside the pack —
  the entry chain serves it or defers, identically on the implicit side.
* The root sequence producers punt all four faces on BOTH packs (a root `- `
  holds no frames); their dedent inputs are `trailingContent`, pinned in §1.
* The flow frame's rider (`FlowBaseRoutes.key` carries the value-line pair
  only — 67b's carrier) and the "no document started" carrier — items 111's
  and 110's residues, untouched here.  (The latter CLOSED by item 116 —
  `noPending.h_nodoc`.) -/
