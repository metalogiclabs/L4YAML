/-! # The landing serves every answer the inline step does (DOCS item 60)

A value on the line BELOW its indicator was three deferral classes — a landed
property run, a landed block scalar, a landed fold — for one reason: the
question was asked TWICE, once with the facts a break-free step has and once
without them.  Asked once, with the separator at the pending's own index and
the floor derived per branch, the landing answers with the same disjuncts:
across the break the floor comes from the landing's own `s-indent(n)` and the
scanner's dedent check rather than from indent stability.

ZERO runtime edits; every pin is an ACCEPT pin. -/
