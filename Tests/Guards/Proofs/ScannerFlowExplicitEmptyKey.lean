/-! # `'?' s-separate ':'` — the explicit entry with an EMPTY key (DOCS item 9n)

Item 9l added `[143] ns-flow-map-explicit-entry`'s `( e-node e-node )` arm
(`[? ]`, `{? }`) and `[146] c-ns-flow-map-empty-key-entry` on the sequence side
(`[: a]`, `[:]`), and deliberately stopped short of their COMPOSITION:

    [150] ns-flow-pair(n,c) ::= ( "?" s-separate ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) )
                              | ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c)

reaches `[146]` through `[143]`'s implicit alternative, so `? : a` and `? :` are
an explicit entry whose key is an `e-node`.  Those two shapes have parsed
correctly since before any of this work, and until item 9n the grammar had no
derivation for them — the same accepts-correct-but-underivable gap Reflection
625 names, deferred on purpose because a constructor with no producer is
inhabitation debt and its only producer is the `:` dispatch.

Item 9n supplies the producer (`FlowOpenStack.receiveColonQuestion`), so the two
constructors land with it.  Nothing about the scanner changed: every `#guard`
below passes before and after, and they exist to pin the shapes the new
`SFlowSeqEntry.explicitEmptyKeyValue` / `.explicitEmptyKeyEmpty` and their
mapping twins derive — the corpus half of the check that the grammar addition
matches the shipped behaviour rather than inventing it.

§3 pins the OTHER tail item 9n closes, `.sep`: a `:` opening an entry with no
key at all.  Its grammar (`emptyKeyValue`/`emptyKeyEmpty`) is 9l's; what is new
is that `FlowOpenStack.receiveColonSep` is TOTAL on that tail — `betweenEmpty`
and `betweenHeld` are its only two frames and a `:` is legal after both.

/-! ## §1  `'?' s-separate ':'` in a flow SEQUENCE

`[150]`'s explicit arm with `[146]` inside it: the entry is a single-pair
mapping whose key is empty. -/

#guard emits "[? : a]\n"

-- `[? :]` — empty key, empty value: `[148] c-ns-flow-map-separate-value`'s
-- `e-node` branch.
#guard emits "[? :]\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ []", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :", "-MAP",

/-! ## §2  The same shapes in a flow MAPPING

`[142]`'s explicit entry rather than `[150]`'s pair, so the pair is emitted
directly into the enclosing mapping. -/

#guard emits "{? : a}\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :a", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :b",
   "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §3  The `.sep` tail: a `:` with no `?` and no key

Item 9l's `[146]` constructors, re-pinned here because item 9n's
`receiveColonSep` is the transition that reaches them — from `betweenEmpty`
(right after the bracket) and from `betweenHeld` (right after a `,`), the two
frames that tail class has. -/

#guard emits "[: a]\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ []", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :a", "-MAP",
   "-SEQ", "-DOC", "-STR"]

#guard emits "[:]\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ []", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :", "-MAP",

#guard emits "[a, : b]\n"

  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :b", "=VAL :", "=VAL :c",
   "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

/-! ## §4  The `.question` tail's OTHER consumers, unchanged

`[? ]` and `[? , a]` are 9l's `( e-node e-node )` shapes: the same
`midQuestion` frame, closed or comma'd instead of colon'd.  Re-pinned so that
adding a second exit from that frame is visible as additive. -/

#guard emits "[? ]\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ []", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :", "-MAP",
   "-SEQ", "-DOC", "-STR"]

#guard emits "[? , a]\n"

   "=VAL :a", "-SEQ", "-DOC", "-STR"]

#guard emits "{? }\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :", "=VAL :", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]

-- `? key : value` — the explicit entry WITH a key, which has had its
-- constructors since long before 9l and is the shape the new ones sit beside.
#guard emits "[? a : b]\n"
  ["+STR", "+DOC", "+SEQ []", "+MAP {}", "=VAL :a", "=VAL :b", "-MAP",
