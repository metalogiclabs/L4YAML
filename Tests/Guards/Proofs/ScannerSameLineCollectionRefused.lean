/-! # The same-line collection refusal (DOCS item 48)

`scanBlockEntry`/`scanKey` refuse a block-context `-`/`?`, and
`scanValueValidate` a `:`, whose line still carries one of three facts the
scanner now records: an IMPLICIT `:` (`implicitValueLine`, stamped by
`scanValue` for `[194]`'s value slot, which is `s-l+block-node` and has no
same-line alternative), a parked `[96] c-ns-properties` run (`[200]` puts
`s-l-comments` between a node's properties and its collection), or a `---`
(`[203]`'s line admits one same-line NODE and nothing else).

The EXPLICIT `:`/`?`/`-` predecessors set none of the three: `[185]`, `[192]`
and `[193]` route through `s-l+block-indented`, whose compact alternatives are
exactly the same-line collections the implicit slot lacks — so `? - a`,
`? a⏎: - w` and `- - : a` stay green while `k: - a` dies.  The pending
`?` survives an implicit `:` RESOLVED DEEPER than the mapping's own column
(spec 8.19's `? earth: blue⏎: moon: white`), which is what keeps the explicit
classification honest across compact keys.

§1 pins the three refused families (all were scanner-accepted and
parser-refused — row 19's over-acceptance, closed by item 48; three were
wrongly ACCEPTED end-to-end: `- : - a`, `: : v`, `: &p a: 1`).  §2 pins the
preserved neighbours at every boundary of the three conditions. -/

/-! ## §2  The preserved neighbours

The EXPLICIT routes (`[185]`/`[192]`/`[193]`) have compact alternatives, so
none of them stamps; a break resets all three reads; and `&a : b` is
`[154]`'s anchored empty key — the `:` never asks the props question
(item 49's legal inhabitant). -/

#guard accepts "? a\n: - w\n"
#guard accepts "- - : a\n"
#guard accepts "- ? - a\n"
-- Spec 8.19: the pending `?` survives an implicit `:` inside its own
