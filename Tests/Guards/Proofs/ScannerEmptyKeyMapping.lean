/-! # The col-0 `:` opens an empty-key block mapping (DOCS item 13)

`[189] c-l-block-map-implicit-value` admits an `e-node` key: a `:` at
column 0 is a complete mapping entry whose key is null.  Item 13 built the
accumulation's first BLOCK-MAPPING state for it — `PendingNode.pendingMapValue`,
the mapping twin of `pendingBlock` — so `: v`, `:`, `: [a]`, `: |` and
`: &a v` stopped escaping through `block_dispatch_deferred`'s `pendingFlow`.

The event streams below pin the shapes those derivations cover, on BOTH
pipelines (the pass is proof-only: no scanner or emitter changed).  A
mapping with a null key is unusual YAML but fully legal, and it is the one
`:` dispatch whose entry needs NO held key — which is what made it the
block-mapping campaign's first completable arm.

**What stays escaped** (and still scans clean): the same-line `:` after
content — `a: b`, the implicit key, needs the parked content re-read in
`.blockKey` context — and the `?` explicit key.  Deliberately not pinned:
over-acceptances are not fixtures (Reflection 622).
