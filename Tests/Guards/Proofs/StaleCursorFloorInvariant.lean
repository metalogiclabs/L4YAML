/-! # The stale-cursor floor, landed and spent (DOCS item 123)

Item 122 corrected U1's conclusion to a CURSOR bound and landed the walks'
cross-line floors; this item lands the invariant itself and spends it:

* **`StaleKeyCursorFloor`** (§1's `rfl` pin): in block context, a live saved
  key from an earlier line puts the cursor strictly past `currentIndent`.
  Preserved by `scanNextToken` (the `KeysBehindCursor` skeleton: the walks
  pay via `ScalarWalkColFloor`'s cross-line floors and §3b's same-line
  column monotonicity; preprocessing fresh-saves across block breaks; a
  flow close's own bracket cleared the structural flow floor; everything
  else clears, saves on the cursor's line, or stays in flow).
* **The spend**: `colon_fires_implicit_key`'s stale branch no longer punts
  on item 104's `[197]` pair — `(s_prep.col : Int) = s_prep.currentIndent`
  is refuted by the floor carried across the no-break step, so the stale-key
  `:` is refuted OUTRIGHT (`invalidImplicitKey` / the pair now both
  machine-decided).  `KeyPackPunt.noFrame` / `.noKeyContext` (U2) and
  `.dedent` (R4) are unchanged.
* §2 re-checks the invariant in its EXACT landed form (with the block-context
  premise) as a step-trace fold over the pinned families, and §4 pins the
  accepted multiline families' event streams — the change is byte-invisible
  to the pipelines (zero runtime edits). -/

/-! ## §2  The landed form at every reachable boundary

Item 122's fold checked the premise-free cursor form; the LANDED invariant
carries the block-context premise, so the fold here is its exact decidable
mirror — seeded at `mk'` and checked after every `scanNextToken`. -/

/-! ## §3  The spend's family is refused for its own reason, unchanged

`? x⏎ y: v` was the pair's flagship input: the continuation line's `y: v`
puts a stale key at the `:`.  It is scanner-refused (both pipelines), and
the accepted explicit-key reading (`? x⏎: v`) still emits — the spend
changed proofs, not bytes. -/
