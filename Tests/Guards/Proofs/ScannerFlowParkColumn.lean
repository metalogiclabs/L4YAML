/-! # A park's own COLUMN, at the two parks that had none (DOCS item 68)

Item 59 gave `pendingBlock` its park column and item 66 spent it: the landing
that under-runs a flow open with a TAB in its indent run is `[63]`'s own
refusal, because a column-0 landing that is not the park is a landing that
crossed a break — `LandingTabFacts`' premise.  `pendingProps` and
`pendingMapValue` carried no column, so the same input rode `scannerDrop`
there; item 68 gives them one and the two arms join `pendingBlock`'s.

The same field carries item 67a's floor onto the flow stack, so a collection
opened over either park reads its interior at the park's own index.

* §1 the OPEN's under-run, both halves, at all three parks.
* §2 the interior floor those parks now hand the stack: a multi-line scalar
  inside the collection is measured against the ENCLOSING block indent, and
  all three scalar styles measure the same way.
* §3 where the route index is 0 the arithmetic is vacuous — a props run parked
  at a mapping VALUE closes at 0, so its collection reads at 0.

ZERO runtime edits: every pin below behaved this way before item 68 too. -/
