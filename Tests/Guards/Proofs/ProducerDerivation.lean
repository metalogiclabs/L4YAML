# Where the thread stops on the producer's side (DOCS item 241)

Item 240 measured the repair lattice and found the `field` repair breaking
exactly one definition: `block_dispatch_deferred`, the producer that builds
the park `PendingNode.pendingFlow`.  That producer is not like the park's
consumers.  It holds `ScannerSurfCorr s' sp_scan'`, a correspondence at the
park's own scan position, so it is the first place in the chain where the datum
the repair needs — `SLYamlStream sp_start sp_scan'` — might be DERIVED instead
of threaded.  (Item 240's mandate has that producer holding a dispatch equation
as well.  It does not: its five hypotheses are the stream to `sp_X`, the arm
disjunction, the correspondence, `h_nodir` and `h_nic0`.  The dispatch
equations belong to the four consumers in §3's first ring.)  **A flip that adds the premise there measures a propagation a
derivation would make zero**, so the derivation is asked about first and the
flip is read afterwards.

## The answer: the datum is a SEED fact, and the park is where the seed is spent

`ScannerSurfCorr` is a correspondence at a POINT — the remaining characters,
the column, the input end, a prefix witness, the signs of the indent stack.
The datum is a statement about a PATH.  §1 proves that the producer's own
premise set does not entail it, in the post-β.5 model item 239 built, and §2
measures what the library derives from a correspondence anywhere:

| reading | what it asks | count |
|---|---|---|
| `free` | a corr HYPOTHESIS, and the CONCLUSION a stream ending there | **0** |
| `pairConcl` | the CONCLUSION puts both at one position | **1** |
| `held` | two HYPOTHESES, a stream ending where a corr stands | **3** |
| `pairAny` | the two meet anywhere in the statement | **8** |

The one conclusion is `initial_stream_and_prefix`, and it is the SEED: input at
offset 0, the stream a `single` over `[202]`'s byte order mark.  The three
premise-holders are seed arms too — `accum_block_on_noPending`,
`accum_content_on_noPending` and `structural_dispatch_to_pending`, whose own
comments call a block-context `noPending` "the stream's seed".  **Nothing in
the library carries a stream to a scanner position except where nothing has
been scanned yet.**  The base case of the induction β.5 needs is the only case
the library has, and `pendingFlow` exists exactly where that case has been
left behind.

## What that makes of the lattice

`scripts/flip_supplier.py --end producer` threads the `field` repair one level:
the park keeps its new field, `close_with_ssl` still reads it, and the producer
gains the premise and spends it.  It reports `producer=4` — the producer's own
consumers, and item 240's `field=1` is the first wave of the same repair
rather than its price.  §3 walks the rest: the producer's thread is 18 long,
**none of the 18 holds the datum**, and it ends at `L4YAML.Surface.parse_strict`
exactly as the supplier's does.

**So `field=1` is not a cheap repair, it is a short first wave.**  Item 240's
answer to item 239 — nineteen statements under `weak` and zero under the other
two — is exact for the question it was asked, which was how many change
*because `close_with_ssl`'s statement changes*; under `field` that lemma's
statement does not change, and the zero is literal.  It is not a claim that the
`field` repair changes no statements.  It changes `block_dispatch_deferred`'s,
and then its thread's, and §3 measures how far.

## The asymmetry the two threads do not share

The supplier's nineteen are all inside item 238's transitive set: `thread \ T`
is empty, so the weak repair redistributes β.5's bill without extending it.
The producer's are not.  §4 measures `prodThread \ T` and finds declarations
that never ride `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop` at all — they build the park or
stand above something that does, but the arm is not in their proof.  **The
`field` repair reaches declarations β.5's bill never named**, which is a cost
the lattice's first-wave counts cannot show.

    one field `block_dispatch_deferred`'s `h_nodir` constrains. -/
def scSeed (input : String) : ScannerState :=
  { ScannerState.mk' input with allowDirectives := false }

/-- …and its correspondence, which is `initial_corr` re-fielded: the update

  ⟨h.chars_from, h.col_eq, h.end_eq, h.input_prefix, h.indent_cols_nonneg⟩

/-- **The producer's premise set does not entail the datum.**

    Every hypothesis `block_dispatch_deferred` holds is listed here — the
    stream to `sp_X`, the arm disjunction, the correspondence, the directive
    flag and the column-zero flag — and the conclusion is the connection the
    `field` repair asks that producer to supply.  The witness is a scanner
    sitting at the start of the input `"b"` while the stream reaches only the
    empty position, which every premise permits because **nothing in the list
    relates `sp_X` to `sp_scan'`**.

    Stated in `StreamND`, item 239's post-β.5 model: the real `SLYamlStream`
    admits `scannerDrop` and therefore proves nothing about positions, which
    is the defect β.5 removes.  A refutation in the model is a statement about
    the repaired library, which is the one being priced. -/

/-- **And where it IS derivable, it is derivable for free.**  At the seed the
    two positions coincide, so the datum is reflexivity.  This is the whole of

    sets, all of them at a scanner that has consumed nothing. -/

/-- The four readings of one declaration.

    They are kept apart because they answer four different questions, and
    merging them would report a rate over the wrong population.  `free` is the
    DERIVATION shape — a correspondence in, a stream at that position out —
    and it is the only one whose emptiness prices anything.  `held` is the
    shape that lets a consumer pay a threaded premise out of what it already
    has.  `pairAny` is the upper bracket: the two named at one position
    anywhere in the statement, nested implications included, where they may
    never be available at the same time.

    **`pairConcl` and `pairAny` compare positions that may be bound**, so two
    variables at the same de Bruijn index under different binders read as one
    and the two counts can over-report.  That is why they are brackets and why
    `free` and `held` — which compare only the telescope's own free variables,
    each globally distinct — carry the findings. -/

    concludes a stream ending where its own correspondence stands.

    The first count moved by one at item 271 and by one again at item 272.
    `underRunEnd_col_le_currentIndent` takes the landing's
    `ScannerSurfCorr s_prep sp_prep` to carry the surface column onto the
    scanner state and concludes an inequality; `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack`
    hands that same correspondence on and concludes a membership on the
