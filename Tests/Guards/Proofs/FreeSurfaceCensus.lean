# What the verified surface says for free (DOCS item 237)

Item 236 derived `InYamlLanguage s` for every string `s` from
`SLYamlStream.scannerDrop`, and left the number nothing held: **how much of the
verified surface is currently true for free?**  A theorem is free here when its
conclusion is provable WITHOUT its hypotheses — every premise it names is dead
weight while the broken arm stands.

Over the library's 103 theorems that mention the top-level surface, **17 are
free, and 15 of those stop being free when β.5 retires the arm.**  That is what
β.5 BUYS.  Every measurement in row 12 before this one priced what it COSTS.

The other 86 are already worth their statement.  Two of the 17 are free by a
route that does not touch the broken arm (`SLYamlStream.single` relates a
position to itself), so β.5 buys nothing at those two and they are not debt.

## The three ways a statement hides from a grep

`InYamlLanguage` is named in five library theorems, and a grep finds all five.
It is ASSERTED in six, because `scan_content_gives_stream_v2` spells the
definition out — `∃ sp_final, SLYamlStream ⟨input.toList, 0⟩ sp_final ∧
sp_final.chars = []` is `InYamlLanguage input`, `rfl`, and §2 checks that.  It
is the lemma the whole `DocumentProduction` chain rests on, and no search for
the name reaches it.

Eleven more are free at `SLYamlStream` itself, where the name `InYamlLanguage`
does not occur at all.  Nine of those are provable by one application of
`scannerDrop` over `stream_refl`, from a single `SSLComments _ target`
hypothesis with every other hypothesis — including their own `SLYamlStream`
premise — discarded.

Provable that way is not proved that way: `ssl_comments_extend_stream` ships a
proof through `implicitContinue`, and this file claims only what it checks,
which is what the STATEMENTS carry.

## What the census reads

The environment, not the source, and its own import closure rather than the
library — the closure is pinned below, and the four library modules outside it
are the serializers, which hold no theorems.  §1 checks that too, because a
coverage census that reads half a library and reports a whole one is how item
236 published `missing=23` for a supply that was already in the build.

## The direction that turned out to be empty

Item 236 recorded a failure mode to watch: `InYamlLanguage` in a HYPOTHESIS
restricts rather than trivializes, and β.5 would weaken such a theorem instead
of strengthening it.  **No library theorem takes `InYamlLanguage` as a
hypothesis** — §1 pins the count at zero, so the direction has no instance
here and β.5 spends nothing in it.

/-! ## §1 The census

Each library theorem is telescoped, its conclusion reduced at `reducible`
transparency, and sorted into one slot by WHERE the top-level surface appears:
at the conclusion's head as `InYamlLanguage`, at its head as `SLYamlStream`,
nested inside the conclusion, or in a hypothesis alone.

Then four candidate proofs are built for it and typechecked against its own
conclusion.  Three come from item 236 — `inYamlLanguage_everything`,
`stream_anything`, `stream_refl` — and the fourth applies `scannerDrop` over
`stream_refl` to one `SSLComments` hypothesis.  A theorem is free when any of
them typechecks, and it survives β.5 when `stream_refl` alone does it. -/

/-! ## §2 The three classes, compiled

Each class is exhibited once.  `parse_strict` and `scan_strict` are NOT
restated here — `SuffixGapAudit.lean` §5 already discharges their statements —
and neither is `empty_InYamlLanguage`, whose standing as the exception that is
not one was recorded at item 236. -/

/-- **A statement can be `InYamlLanguage` without naming it.**  This is
    `scan_content_gives_stream_v2`'s conclusion, and the equation is `rfl`. -/
example (input : String) :
    (∃ sp_final : SurfPos, SLYamlStream ⟨input.toList, 0⟩ sp_final ∧
      sp_final.chars = []) = InYamlLanguage input := rfl

/-- `scan_content_gives_stream_v2`'s statement, discharged without its
    hypothesis.  It is what the whole `DocumentProduction` chain rests on. -/
example (input : String) (tokens : Array (L4YAML.Positioned L4YAML.YamlToken))
    (_h : L4YAML.Scanner.scan input = .ok tokens) :
    ∃ sp_final : SurfPos, SLYamlStream ⟨input.toList, 0⟩ sp_final ∧
      sp_final.chars = [] :=
  inYamlLanguage_everything input

/-- `ssl_comments_extend_stream`'s statement, discharged without its stream
    hypothesis — the nine-theorem `drop` class.  The shipped proof goes through
    `implicitContinue` and uses both; what is free is the STATEMENT. -/
example (sp_start sp sp_final : SurfPos)
    (_h_stream : SLYamlStream sp_start sp) (h_ssl : SSLComments sp sp_final) :
    SLYamlStream sp_start sp_final :=
  SLYamlStream.scannerDrop sp_start sp_start sp sp_final (stream_refl sp_start) h_ssl

/-! ## §3 What β.5 buys

Fifteen of the seventeen are free only through `scannerDrop`.  When β.5 lands,
§1 throws, and the count it reports is the content those fifteen statements
gained — including both acceptance capstones, which say nothing today.

Two do not move.  `empty_to_stream` and `empty_yaml_stream` close by
`SLYamlStream.single`, which relates a position to itself and is untouched by
β.5; they were never debt.

What this file does NOT establish is that the fifteen become unprovable.  It
found one route to each and that route runs through the broken arm; whether
another exists is settled by β.5 landing, not by this census.  An inconclusive
direction is recorded as inconclusive. -/
