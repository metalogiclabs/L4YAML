/-! # The indent stack's base, threaded (DOCS item 128)

Item 127 read a popping landing's column off the top entry and had to carry one
escape: `s_prep.indents.size ≤ 1`, a stack popped to a single entry.  That entry
is the sentinel at column `-1`, which no landing column equals — but saying so
is `ScannerState.WellFormed`'s sixth conjunct, and the accumulation carried no
`WellFormed` at all (it is preserved for `advance` and `emit` only).

This item carries the sixth conjunct ALONE — `IndentStackBase.SentinelBase`, a
statement about `indents[0]?` — through every scanner step, in the shape the two
other whole-scanner field walks already use (`ScannerFlowStackPreservation`,
`ScannerEkStackPreservation`).  The stack has exactly four writers
(`pushMappingIndent`, `pushSequenceIndent`, `unwindIndentsLoop` and
`scanValuePrepare`'s own `push`) and each keeps index 0: a push writes past the
end, and the unwind's guard stops at size 1.  So
`preprocess_landing_at_level` is an equation outright now, with no disjunct.

**The escape's family, measured** (§2).  A stack popped to its base is what an
INDENTED root leaves behind — `  a: 1` pushes a mapping level at column 2 over
the sentinel — and every landing to the left of it is `trailingContent` in both
pipelines, at the column the landing sits at rather than at the level's.  The
comment line, the `...` and the `---` do not save it: preprocessing unwinds
before any of them is dispatched.

§1 types the invariant, its seed and its step.  §2 is the runtime.  §3 types the
landing equation, which no longer offers the escape. -/

/-! ## §1  The invariant, its seed, and its step -/

/-- The predicate is the sixth conjunct, packaged so it carries non-emptiness. -/
example (s : ScannerState) :
    SentinelBase s ↔ s.indents[0]? = some { column := -1, isSequence := false } :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- The seed: the scanner starts on the sentinel alone. -/
example (input : String) : SentinelBase (ScannerState.mk' input) := mk'_base input

/-- The step: every `scanNextToken` keeps it. -/
example {s s' : ScannerState} (hok : scanNextToken s = .ok (some s'))
    (h : SentinelBase s) : SentinelBase s' := scanNextToken_base hok h

/-- …and the two consequences item 127's escape needed: a base is non-empty, and
    a stack that is ONLY its base sits at `-1`. -/
example {s : ScannerState} (h : SentinelBase s) : 0 < s.indents.size := h.size_pos

example {s : ScannerState} (h : SentinelBase s) (hsz : s.indents.size ≤ 1) :
    s.currentIndent = -1 := h.currentIndent_of_size_le_one hsz

/-- The four writers, each keeping index 0. -/
example (s : ScannerState) (col : Int) (h : SentinelBase s) :
    SentinelBase (unwindIndents s col) := unwindIndents_base s col h

example (s : ScannerState) (col : Int) (h : SentinelBase s) :
    SentinelBase (pushMappingIndent s col) := pushMappingIndent_base s col h

example (s : ScannerState) (col : Int) (h : SentinelBase s) :
    SentinelBase (pushSequenceIndent s col) := pushSequenceIndent_base s col h

example (s : ScannerState) (h : SentinelBase s) :
    SentinelBase (scanValuePrepare s) := scanValuePrepare_base s h

-- (b) The escape's own shape — a landing that would pop the last real level —

#guard scannerRefuses "  a:\n    b: 1\nc: 2\n"

#guard scannerRefuses "  a: 1\n...\nb: 2\n"
#guard scannerRefuses "  a: 1\n---\nb: 2\n"

-- (c) The ORDINARY dedent, for contrast: a level survives the pop, the landing
-- sits at its column, and item 127's equation is about exactly this.
#guard emits "a:\n  b: 1\nc: 2\n"

   "=VAL :c", "=VAL :2", "-MAP", "-DOC", "-STR"]
#guard accepts "  a:\n    b: 1\n  c: 2\n"

-- (d) The boundary that says the refusal comes from the POP and not from the
-- column: a root flow node pushes no level at all, so the same landing leaves
-- the scanner clean and dies in the parser instead (item 119's M1 family —
-- `ScannerRaisedFlagRefusalMap`).
#guard scansClean "  [1, 2]\nb: 2\n"
#guard refuses "  [1, 2]\nb: 2\n"
