# Which of the statements riding the arm are FALSE, not merely unproved (DOCS item 239)

Item 238 measured the ring around `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop` — `D=4` proofs
build it, `T=26` run through it, `S=0` statements name it — and left the
number that decides between the floor and the ceiling: **how many of the
twenty-six are FALSE once the arm is gone, rather than merely unproved?**  A
statement that is merely unproved costs β.5 a reproof.  A statement that is
false costs a restatement, and every consumer that reads its type.

The answer is **six**.  The law β.5 buys cannot decide the other twenty, and
the reason nobody had written it down is that *the law is silent about a
conclusion that ends at end of input.*  This file refutes six and reports the
twenty as undecided by the only law this row has measured — an inconclusive
result is not a negative one.

    free=4  negation=3  empty=10  bound=9   (26)
    refuted=6   library=2   guardExhibit=4

## The vacuity trap this file had to walk around

`SLYamlStream s s' → s'.chars <:+ s.chars` is FALSE in the ambient environment
— that is item 236's refutation and it is what β.5 exists to repair.  So
`suffixLaw → P` is derivable for every `P`, and any instrument that ASSUMES the
law proves every statement false, reports a perfect score, and measures
nothing.

§1 walks around it by building the post-β.5 environment instead of assuming
it: `StreamND` carries `SLYamlStream`'s three surviving arms and omits the
fourth.  §2 proves the suffix law OF THAT MODEL by induction, with no
hypothesis anywhere, so no verdict below rests on an implication.  A model
that drifts from the thing it models measures nothing either, so §1 pins the
three copied arm types against the ambient constructors structurally rather
than by eye.

## What decides a verdict, and it is the conclusion's binder

The law constrains a derivation's TARGET.  So it can contradict a statement
only where the statement PINS a target the law forbids:

- **free** — the conclusion is `SLYamlStream a b` with `b` universally
  quantified and unreached by the premises.  The statement then asserts a
  stream to an arbitrary position, and one instance refutes it.
- **bound** — the target is existentially quantified.  The law is a constraint
  the witness must meet, not a contradiction, and meeting it is what a reproof
  does.
- **empty** — the target is existentially quantified AND pinned to
  `chars = []`.  `[] <:+ anything` (§6), so the law's verdict on these is
  satisfied before it is asked.
- **negation** — the statement is `¬ law`, and it is false exactly when the
  model proves that law.

The census is a filter and not a verdict — item 236's lesson, and the reason
§4 settles each of the four candidates by compiling a refutation rather than by
reading the class off a type.  Four candidates, four refutations, no residue.

## The class nobody had counted, and it holds every Group 7 row

**Ten of the twenty-six conclude at end of input**, including all four of the
Group 7 rows the arm carries — `parse_strict_proof` (7.1),
`scan_content_gives_stream_v2` (7.2), `scanLoop_grammar_prod` (7.3) and
`scan_strict_proof` (7.6) — together with `parse_strict`, `scan_strict`, the
three accumulation lemmas that end a scan (`eof_pending`,
`preprocessing_eof_extends_stream`, `scanNextToken_none_stream`) and
`inYamlLanguage_everything`.  The law β.5 buys says of each
of them only that `[]` is a suffix of the input, which is true of every
string.  **β.5 owes Group 7 a reproof and not one changed character of any of
its statements**, and that is a stronger reading than item 238's `S=0`: `S=0`
says no statement NAMES the arm, this says no statement CONTRADICTS the law
that replaces it.  It does not say the reproofs are easy; it says they are
reproofs.

## The two the repair actually reaches

`dropClose` and `PendingNode.close_with_ssl` are the two library statements in
the free class, and both are refuted.  `close_with_ssl` is the one item 238
left open — it is restrictive in its `PendingNode` premise, so the question
was whether that premise can be met at a target the law forbids.  It can:
`PendingNode.pendingFlow` constrains `sp_scan.col` against scanner booleans
and nothing else, so §5 builds the park at a `sp_scan` holding characters
`sp_start` never had, and builds it WITHOUT the arm.  The remaining four
refutations are guard exhibits — `stream_anything` twice,
`stream_suffix_refuted` and `stream_span_refuted` — which exist to witness the
defect and are deleted with it rather than repaired.

## Why row 12 names both halves of β.5, measured

`pendingFlow` is the only one of the park's constructors whose premises leave
`sp_block` unconnected to `sp_scan`; every other arm carries its own closing
evidence.  So the two verdicts are not the same kind of verdict:

- `dropClose` is false **unconditionally** — its own two premises are already
  independent.
- `close_with_ssl` is false **in the environment that deletes the arm and keeps
  the park**.  Retiring `pendingFlow` removes the case that refutes it.

Deleting the arm alone therefore leaves a false lemma in the library.  Row 12
names β.5 *"retire `pendingFlow`, delete `scannerDrop`"*, and this is the
measured reason the two halves are one item rather than two.

**What a restatement then costs is a separate measurement and a separate
choice.**  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/RepairChoice.lean` (DOCS item 240) prices the
three repairs of `close_with_ssl` — a premise on the lemma, the same
connection as a field on the park, or retiring the park — and only the first
changes the lemma's own type.  It reuses §4's witness: `flowPark` refutes the
premise's other source, so the premise has to be threaded from above.

    contradict them, so nothing here asks for a changed statement; whether each
    is REPROVABLE is a separate question this file does not open. -/
example (a : SurfPos) : ([] : List Char) <:+ a.chars := List.nil_suffix

/-- **The `bound` class, in one line.**  Nine conclude
    `∃ sp_gram', SLYamlStream sp_start sp_gram' ∧ …`, and an existential target
    turns the law into a constraint the witness must meet.  A target equal to
    the source meets it, so the law rules out no such statement on its own,
    which is weaker than saying the statement holds. -/
example (a : SurfPos) : a.chars <:+ a.chars := List.suffix_refl _

/-- **`stream_colLaw_refuted` is the one negation that survives.**  `ColLaw` is
    `(∃ pre, Span s s' pre) ∧ ColMono s s' ∧ ColBreak s s'`, and the model
    proves the first conjunct only; the other two are item 235's column walk,
    priced at 319 citations over 86 lemmas and unbuilt.  Refuting the negation
    needs all three. -/

/-- **`inYamlLanguage_everything` is not refuted either, and it is the one a
    reader would expect to be.**  `InYamlLanguage s` asserts a derivation
    ending at `chars = []`; the law says `[] <:+ s.toList`, which holds.

    grammar does NOT derive — and no instrument in this row has one. -/
