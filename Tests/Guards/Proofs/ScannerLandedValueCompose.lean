/-! # The indented entry's landed value composes (DOCS item 52)

`k:⏎  -⏎    a` — the entry's value on its OWN line — is `[196]
s-l+block-node`'s flow-in-block reading whose separator is
`[70] s-separate-lines(n)`: the crossed break plus the fresh line's
`s-indent(n)`.  The break-free reading is index-UNIVERSAL (the index never
occurs, item 23), which is why only the inline arms composed; the landing's
separator CONSUMES the index, so the reading exists at exactly the pending's
own `n` — `preprocess_some_separate_at_anyCol` (item 45) had built it at any
`n`, and item 52 is its first indented consumer.  ZERO runtime edits: every
pin here is an ACCEPT pin, and what moves is the derivation (the two
indented content arms' landing case parks arm 1's pending with the
fixed-index separator instead of deferring).

Pinned: the sequence-entry landing at both widths, quoted, with a sibling
snoc, with a nested mapping value; the empty-key and explicit-key mapping
twins, with a sibling entry.  The landed props/block-scalar/fold shapes stay
deferred (their own classes) but accepted — pinned as plain accepts. -/
