/-! # The tab in front of a compact fill is refused (DOCS item 58)

The `?`'s key slot and the explicit `:`'s value slot are filled by a same-line
`-`/`?`/`:` (item 51's compact alternatives).  A TAB in the whites in front of
that indicator is §6.1's — `[63] s-indent(n)` is spaces — and the scanner
refuses every shape; what the production proof lacked was the COORDINATE the
`:` half of the refutation reads, the park's own `simpleKeyAllowed`, which
`scanKey`/`scanValue` both set and the pending now carries.

ZERO runtime edits: the pins below are the scanner's own behavior, and what
moved is that the arm refutes them instead of deferring. -/
