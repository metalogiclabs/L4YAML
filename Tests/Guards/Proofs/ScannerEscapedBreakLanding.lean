/-! # The escaped break's landing is a fold (DOCS item 87)

`[112] s-double-escaped(n)` is `s-white* c-escape b-non-content
l-empty(n,FLOW-IN)* s-flow-line-prefix(n)`.  Two consequences the escape arm
used to skip:

* each blank line the landing opens is `[70] l-empty`, which folds to a LINE
  FEED — the arm handed those lines, stripped, to the next fold, whose
  `b-non-content` slot then swallowed the landing's own break (one `\n` short
  on every blank landing, and `b-as-space` where the landing was the only
  blank line);
* the blank landing's white run owes the same §6.1 floor as the fold's blank
  lines (`[63] s-indent` is spaces; `[64] s-indent-lt(n)` takes its break
  immediately), so a run that reaches a tab before the floor matches neither
  arm of `[70]` — item 62's gate, which the arm bypassed.

Both close by running the landing through `foldQuotedNewlines` itself, with
`b-as-space` mapped to nothing (the escaped break is excluded from content)
and no trailing trim (`[112]` preserves the `s-white*` before the escape).
The refusals below were accepts; the content rows moved by exactly the
landing's line feed.  Every content row's value matches PyYAML 6.0.3.  The
§1 refusals are the spec's own — `[63] s-indent` is spaces, so a run that
reaches a tab before the floor matches neither arm of `[70]` — and PyYAML
accepts all three, as it accepts item 62's un-escaped family
(`k:⏎  - "a⏎→⏎    b"`): its laxity is uniform here, not a datum about the
escape path. -/
