# Reflection 631 — a behaviour change's price is INVARIANT ripple + SHAPE ripple

**The rule.** When a step's behaviour changes, two different sets of proofs
break, and they are counted differently.

  * The **invariant ripple** — proofs that transport a predicate across the
    step. Bounded by the invariant families the step appears in.
  * The **shape ripple** — proofs that quote the step's RESULT RECORD
    literally. Bounded by nothing an invariant analysis can see, and in a
    codebase with per-step reduction lemmas it is the larger number by far.

**The corollary that makes the invariant ripple free.** If the change makes a
step behave like its SIBLINGS — here, "the `,` clears the pending simple key",
which is what every other flow step already did — then every invariant family
already owns the constructor the new behaviour needs, because some sibling
already needed it. Nothing new gets proved; each site is a one-line swap from
`*_of_preserved` to `*_of_cleared_preserved`.

**The instance (L4YAML item 9q).** Item 9p priced the `scanFlowEntry`
normalization as "its own ripple: the `SimpleKeyAbove` / `SimpleKeyAboveFloor` /
`AllKeysValid` family, 6 sites". Building it found eleven invariant sites, not
six — and **zero** new invariant constructors, because all eleven families
(five plain, six indexed) already had a cleared-key constructor. The forty
sites that actually carried the diff were statement sites spelling
`{ … with simpleKeyAllowed := true, explicitKeyLine := none }`, the step's
result record, which the pricing never mentioned because no invariant runs
through them.

**And a normalization pays part of its own price.** Two `EndLineOnLine`
obligations became vacuous (a cleared key has nothing to say about lines),
freeing an `h_endline` hypothesis in each of two step lemmas; and the one
lemma whose conclusion had to change — the `,`'s simple-key add-on — became
what all six of its consumers actually wanted, which is why all six had been
discarding the old conclusion with `_`.

Self-contained: models the two ripples over the shipped instance's shape and
pins that the priced one is neither the larger nor the expensive one.
