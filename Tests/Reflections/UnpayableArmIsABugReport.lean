# Reflection 682 — an unpayable arm is a bug report

**The rule.**  A deferred arm has a fourth way out, and it is the one nobody
looks for: the arm is INHABITED, the specification has no derivation for it,
and therefore the MACHINE is wrong.  Reflection 661 named three exits —
derive the shape, refute it from what the machine did, or find the arm
describes a state never entered.  All three leave the runtime alone.  The
fourth changes it, and it is the only exit available when the arm's inputs
exist, reach the arm, and are accepted: no derivation can be written (the
grammar has no production), no refutation can be written (the scan really did
take that branch), and the arm is not vacuous (a three-line input reaches it).
What remains is that the accepter accepts something the grammar does not
generate — a soundness bug, reported by the proof rather than by a test.

**Why it stays hidden.**  The arm is only a bug report when it is LOCATED.
`∨ True` says "some blank line was not readable" and admits every diagnosis,
including "the proof is too weak"; the located form names the coordinate — `j`
spaces, then a tab, at column `j` — and that is simultaneously the missing
derivation, the input that exhibits it, and the condition a runtime check
would test.  §3 is the point: an unlocated arm is CONSISTENT with a correct
machine, so it cannot be a bug report; the located one is not.

**And the fix has a shape.**  Because the located arm is exactly the check's
firing condition, narrowing the runtime does not merely make the arm
unreachable — it makes the arm's own hypothesis contradictory, so the residue
DELETES rather than shrinking, and the disjunction goes with it (§4).  A
runtime check bolted on for other reasons would not do this; the check has to
be the arm read as a predicate.

**The instance** (item 62).  `[70] l-empty(n,c)` opens with `s-line-prefix`
or `[64] s-indent-lt(n)`, both beginning in `[63] s-indent`, which is spaces;
a tab is admitted only by `[69] s-flow-line-prefix(n)`'s trailing
`s-separate-in-line?`, i.e. only past the `n`th space.  A blank fold line with
fewer than `n` spaces and then a tab therefore has no reading — and both
pipelines scanned `k:⏎  - "a⏎<TAB>⏎    b"` clean.  Six items had carried the
arm as "a future runtime check refuses it".  The check is one conjunction, the
fold's own §6.1 gate read one line earlier, and with it
`foldQuotedNewlinesLoop_prod_at` loses its disjunction outright.

§3 unlocated vs located; §4 the narrowing empties the arm. -/
