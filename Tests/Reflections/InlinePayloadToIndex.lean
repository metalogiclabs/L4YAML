# Reflection 610 — inline the payload to index it

A state type that *packages* a payload (`state := wrap (p : Payload l)`) cannot be
indexed by "which payload constructor built it": the payload is a `Prop`, so no
function can read its constructor back out, and no index can be attached to the
wrapper after the fact.  When a guard supplied from outside distinguishes exactly
those constructors, the payload has to be **spread into the outer type** — one
outer constructor per payload shape, each naming its own index.

This is what L4YAML's item 9b(ii) had to do: `SeqFrame`/`MapFrame` wrapped a
`PartialFlowSeq` / `PendingFlowSeqEntry`, and the scanner's two flow guards
(`scanFlowEntry`'s `invalidFlowEntry`, `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency`) reject
exactly certain payload constructors.  Inlining the 7 (resp. 8) shapes into the
frame types let each one carry a `FrameTail` index, which is what turned the
scanner guards into hypotheses the frame transitions could use.

The toy below is the smallest faithful model: three shapes of a
partially-built flow collection, and the `,` transition that is **provable on the
inlined type and outright false on the wrapped one**.

    The index alone rules out the two degenerate shapes: `cases` never reaches
    them, because their index is `.sep`. -/

/-- **NEGATIVE** — the same transition is FALSE on the wrapped type. The
    degenerate leading-comma shape (`[,`) is in scope and `[Tok.comma]` is not a
    `Part` at all, so there is no way to state the transition, let alone prove
    it, without a classification the wrapper does not carry. -/

/-! ## The outside guard is a decidable function of the token history

    In the real setting these are `scanFlowEntry`'s `invalidFlowEntry` check and
    `tailOf (lastRealTokenVal? sc.tokens)`. The point of the index is that they
    agree: the guard accepts exactly the `.value`-tailed states. -/

    another `,`. -/

#guard guardOk [Tok.atom, Tok.comma] == false

/-- Guard and index agree on every shape: the guard passes exactly where the tail
    is `.value`. This is the coupling the invariant has to carry — the index is
    useless unless it is pinned to what the guard actually reads. -/
