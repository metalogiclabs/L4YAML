# Reflection 676 — an over-acceptance behind a gate is closed by deleting the gate

**The rule.**  When a family of invalid inputs is accepted although the
refusing CHECK exists and runs on the family's neighbours, look for the gate:
a conjunct that exempts exactly the accepted family, priced at some point as
"the spec requires the leniency" and never checked against the productions.
The closure then costs a DELETION per family — no new machinery, no new
invariant — and the discrimination against the sibling shape matters: item 48
needed new checks and new park fields because nothing recorded its facts;
item 50's three families each sat one conjunct away from a check their
neighbours already met.  Before building, grep the guard for exemptions and
read each against the grammar rule it claims to serve.

**The instance** (item 50).  Three flow-floor leniencies, three gates:
`]`/`}` were exempt from the under-indent guard (`[137]`/`[140]` sit inside
`s-l+flow-in-block(n)`'s `ns-flow-node(n+1)`, so the closers clear the same
floor — the exemption served nothing); the fold's §6.1 tab check was
`!inFlow`-gated (`[69] s-flow-line-prefix(n)` begins with `[63] s-indent(n)`,
spaces in either context); and the flow plain continuation had no floor read
at all — the one genuine addition, and it is the same `≤ currentIndent`
comparison its quoted neighbour had made since item 7.  All four §2 pins of
`ScannerIndexedFlowCompose` flip; matrix and eventscore are unmoved — no
valid input ever lived in a gate's shadow.

§1 the toy: a floor check with an exemption for the "closer".  §2 the
over-acceptance, witnessed through the gate; §3 the deletion refuses it and
every properly indented input still passes — the good set never met the
gate. -/
