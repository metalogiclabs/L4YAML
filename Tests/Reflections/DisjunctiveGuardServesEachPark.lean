# Reflection 674 — a disjunctive guard serves each park its own disjunct

**The rule.**  When one runtime guard fires on a DISJUNCTION of recorded
facts, one refutation lemma closes every park that carries any single
disjunct: the park pays only its own fact, the refuter takes the disjunction,
and the transport clauses are shared.  Three arms close for the price of one
lemma — and a park that cannot decide its disjunct pays `∨ True` and keeps
the escape, so the fourth arm costs DOMAIN rather than soundness
(Reflection 653's optional field, on the refutation side).

**The instance** (item 48).  `scanBlockEntry`/`scanKey` refuse on
`implicitValueLine == some line || lastTokenIsNodePropertyOnLine ||
docStartOnLine`, and `scanValueValidate` on the first and third.
`dispatch_refutes_sameLine` takes the three facts as one disjunction;
`pendingMapValue` pays the stamp (implicit `:` only — the explicit `:` pays
`∨ True` and stays escapable), `pendingProps` pays the trailing-token read,
`pendingDocStart` pays the marker, and all three ride the same clause-1
payload (`s_prep.line = sc.line`, `lastRealToken?` preserved).

§1 the toy machine: a stamp, a tail flag, and a guard that fires on either.
§2 one refuter, consumed by both single-fact parks.  §3 the optional park:
its left inhabitants refute, and the claim that ALL of them do is FALSE —
the `∨ True` side names the survivors instead of overclaiming them away.
