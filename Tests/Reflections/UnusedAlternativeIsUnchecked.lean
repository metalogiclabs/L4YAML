# Reflection 659 — an alternative nothing produces is an alternative nothing has checked

**The rule.**  A constructor that compiles is a constructor whose TYPES are
right.  Its numeric arguments — an index, a width, an offset — are checked by
nothing at all until something instantiates them.  So an alternative of a
production with zero producers and zero consumers carries an arithmetic claim
with zero evidence behind it, no matter how long it has been in the tree, how
carefully it is annotated, or how often the comments cite it.  Age reads as
authority and is not: the elaborator never looked.

**And the first consumer is not the test — the SIBLING is.**  An off-by-one in
a collection's index is invisible on a collection of one, because the opener's
own position is supplied by the opener.  It becomes visible on the second
element, whose indentation the index is what decides.  So when you build the
first producer for a dormant alternative, the pin to write first is the two-element
case; a green one-element pin is compatible with every index you might have
written.  This is [[VacuityIsAClaimAboutTheRuntime]] moved from a branch to a
number, and it is the bill for the debt [[AutoDetectedIsExistential]] §3
declined to run up, arriving from the other direction: that item refused to add
a constructor with no arm, and this one found the constructor that had been
sitting there without one.

**Why it was dormant is the second lesson.**  The escape this item closed had
been described for a dozen items as an evidence gap: the step crosses no break,
so `[79] s-l-comments` cannot exist, so nothing can close — irreducible.  That
description is true and it is about the alternatives already CONSUMED.  Read
the production's alternative list instead and the partition is stark: the
consumed set coincided exactly with the set that demands the missing evidence
(`consumed_is_exactly_the_evidence_demanding_set`), so on the residue every
consumed alternative was unavailable and every available one unconsumed.  A
gap that looks irreducible from inside the consumed set is worth re-reading as
"which alternatives do NOT ask for the thing I cannot get".

**What kept it unexpressible was an interface, not a proof.**  The pending's
entry-level closure was an ACCUMULATOR — "here is what has been accumulated,
and here is how to spend any extension of it" — and that shape obliges the
producer to name a BEGINNING.  A compact collection has no beginning to name:
its first entry is not preceded by its own indentation, so it is not an element
of the collection type at all.  The CONTINUATION shape — "give me the rest and
I will close" — names no beginning, admits the empty rest, and agrees with the
accumulator wherever both exist.  Prefer it: a continuation is offerable by
strictly more producers at strictly no cost, and this one turned five existing
snoc sites into constructor applications on the way in.

Concretely (L4YAML): `[185] s-l+block-indented(n,c)` has four alternatives; the
accumulation consumed `s-l+block-node` and `e-node s-l-comments` and had never
touched `s-indent(m) ns-l-compact-sequence(n+1+m)` or its mapping twin — which
are precisely the two that need no comments, because a compact collection shares
the entry indicator's line.  Both had been written `n+m`, one column left of the
truth, since nothing instantiated the index.  Building the consumer put `- - a`,
`- : a`, `- ? a` and their nestings into the grammar, and `- - a⏎  - b` — the
sibling — is what showed the index.

§1 the arithmetic nothing checked.  §2 the sibling is the test.  §3 the
alternatives nobody consumed.  §4 continuation over accumulator.  §5 the
shipped counts.

/-! ## §2  A one-element collection cannot tell them apart

`s-indent(N)` is what stands in front of every entry of a collection at index
`N` — except the compact opener's, which the enclosing entry supplies.  So the
index constrains the SIBLINGS and only the siblings. -/

/-- The columns of the entries that follow the opener.  Each is `s-indent(N)`
    from a line start, so each must be exactly `N`. -/

theorem agrees_without_a_sibling (n m : Nat) :
    tailWellIndented (writtenIndex n m) [] ↔ tailWellIndented (compactIndex n m) [] := by

    the written index demands it one column to the left. -/

/-! ## §3  The alternatives nobody consumed were the ones that fit

The production's four alternatives, sorted by whether they demand the closing
evidence — `[79] s-l-comments`, which exists only across a break or at a line
start — and by whether the accumulation had a consumer for them. -/

    needs the missing evidence, so from inside the consumed set there was
    genuinely nothing to do. -/
