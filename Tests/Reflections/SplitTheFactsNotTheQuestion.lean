# Reflection 681 — split the facts, not the question

**The rule.**  When two situations reach the same question with DIFFERENT facts
in hand, split the facts and ask the question once.  Splitting the question
instead — a branch per situation, each with its own copy of the answers — costs
coverage silently: the branch written second gets whichever answers its author
had appetite for, and every answer missing there reads afterwards as a separate
"class" of deferral, one per answer rather than one per missing FACT.  The
count of deferral classes is then an artifact of the duplication, and merging
the branches deletes them all at once (§3, §4).

The merge is only available when each situation can produce the facts in its
own way, so the second half of the rule is: state each fact at the weakest form
BOTH can supply, and make optional the one that only the first can (§2).  A
fact one side cannot give is not a reason to duplicate the question — it is a
reason to make that fact optional and let the answer that needs it punt.

**The instance** (item 60).  A value on the line BELOW its indicator deferred
as three classes — a landed property run, a landed block scalar, a landed fold
— because `indentedValue_reads_at_any_indent` asked its question in two
branches: the break-free one (with the universal separator and indent
stability) got all five answers, the landing got one.  Asked once, with the
separator at the pending's own index, the stability optional, and the FLOOR
derived per branch — from stability inline, and across a break from the
landing's own `s-indent(n)` plus the scanner's dedent check
(`preprocess_some_floor_at_landing`) — every answer serves both, and the three
classes vanish together with one dead disjunct (item 52's landing case,
identical to the inline one once the quantifier moved).

§1 the facts and the answers; §2 the weakest form both sides supply; §3 asked
once, both situations answer; §4 asked twice, the second copy loses coverage —
and the loss counts as one class per ANSWER. -/
