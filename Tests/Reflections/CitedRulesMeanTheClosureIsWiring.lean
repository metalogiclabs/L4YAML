# Reflection 675 — an escape that cites its inhabitant's rules is closed by wiring

**The rule.**  A deferral arm annotated with the RULE NUMBERS of its one
grammatical inhabitant is a closure whose cost is one application: if the
cited constructors elaborate against each other — the run as the key
alternative, the key under the entry, the entry through a route somebody
already carries — then no new surface constructor, no new invariant field
and no runtime edit is owed, and the item is a producer that composes what
exists.  Check the overlap the way Reflection 667 reads an empty product:
by TYPES, before writing the call.  Conversely, an escape whose comment can
only describe its inhabitant in prose is signalling a missing constructor —
the two annotations price differently and should not be confused.

**The instance** (item 49).  `pendingProps`' `:` arm had carried its ask in
its own docstring since item 42: `&a : b` is "`[154]`'s anchored empty key"
— `[161] ns-flow-node`'s props-only alternative under `[193]`'s implicit
key.  All three constructors existed (`SFlowNode.propsEmpty`,
`SImplicitKey.jsonKey`, `SBlockMapEntry.implicitKeyNode`), and the entry
route had been carried by `PropsKeyPack` since item 41 — so the closure is
`colon_open_map_props`, one producer applying them in order, zero new
grammar, zero runtime change, and the escape narrows to the pack-less parks.

§1 the toy: a run, a key with a run-reading arm, an entry, and a route that
consumes the entry — four EXISTING pieces.  §2 the wiring is one
definition, and the closed arm is a theorem.  §3 the discrimination:
without the run arm the same obligation is UNPROVABLE from the same pieces
(a run heads where no scalar does), so a prose-only escape names a
genuinely missing constructor, not an unapplied one.

    a producer. -/
