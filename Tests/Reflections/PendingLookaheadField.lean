# Reflection 634 — one dispatch of lookahead, carried as a field on the
# pending state

**The rule.**  Reflection 633's companion mask priced a strictened guard's
firing direction at depth ≥ 1.  Site 5 — the depth-0 flow open arriving with
no break crossed — needed the OPPOSITE ingredient: not a mask over a stack,
but ONE DISPATCH of lookahead, carried by the pending state itself.  Three
lessons made it land:

1. **The refutation fact is the producer's own trailing validation.**  Every
   pending whose construct is COMPLETE was built right after a guard that
   validated the rest of the line (`validateTrailingContent`,
   `validateAliasClose`, `validateFlowClose`, `scanDocumentEnd`'s suffix
   probe) or after a scan that cannot stop before a bracket (plain scalars
   absorb `[`; block scalars end at column 0 or EOF).  Packaging that window
   as a REST-OF-LINE field on the constructor (`s-white*` then never `[`/`{`)
   turns "the guard ran one dispatch earlier" into a hypothesis the flow-open
   arm can consume — and the ¬-form predicate is what lets SIX producer
   families with DIFFERENT allowlists share ONE consumer.

2. **A validator behind the walk pays its own fuel.**  The white-skip loops'
   fuel-exhaustion cases vanish for free wherever a validator follows: if
   fuel died mid-whites the landing peek would be a white, which no allowlist
   admits, so `.ok` itself refutes exhaustion.  Only the two loops with NO
   validator behind them (plain scalar, block scalar) pay a genuine
   fuel-adequacy induction.

3. **Sort the pendings by producer guarantee, not by "closeable".**  The plan
   said "refute the four non-props pendings"; enumerating producers showed
   `pendingFlow` — the deferred catch-all — is legally inhabited here
   (`- - [a]`, `? [a]`) and CANNOT be refuted.  It rides its own closing
   strategy instead: the resume ignores the content evidence and applies the
   same `scannerDrop` its break-case close already uses.  And the legal
   inhabitant (`&a [b]`, `- &a [b]`, `&a⏎[b]`) became a STATE:
   `pendingProps`, whose two closures (`propsEmpty` close, `propsContent`
   ride) capture the enclosing route, so one constructor serves the bare
   document, the block entry, and the explicit document alike.

**The milestone.**  `StreamAccum.lean` reached ZERO sorries — β.3 complete —
and `L4YAML.Capstones`, the only failing target of the whole campaign, went
GREEN: `parse_strict_proof` dropped its `sorryAx` dependency and now matches
its pinned axiom profile.  All with zero scanner changes: this pass is
proof-only, corpus byte-identical by construction.

Self-contained: pins the shipped instance's counts (L4YAML item 9t,
2026-08-10).
