# Reflection 632 — a strictened guard's THIRD ripple is the hypothesis chain,
# and it climbs to the weakest producer

**The rule.**  Reflection 631 priced a behaviour change as invariant ripple
plus shape ripple.  LANDING a strictened guard exposes a third, and it is the
one that dominates: the **hypothesis ripple**.  The guard's new discharge
premise must be SUPPLIABLE at every proof that runs through the guard — so it
becomes a hypothesis on the def family, and the supplier chain climbs caller
by caller until it reaches a producer that concretely owns the fact (here:
the `{` or `,` whose push IS the entry boundary).  Price it by walking the
WEAKEST def of the family: every hypothesis of the discharge that the weakest
producer cannot derive is a new def-family hypothesis, and its cost is the
family's caller count — not the guard's site count.

**The corollary that restructures producers.**  Chasing the weakest producer
found the plain tower's mapping case needing the saved-key LAYOUT of its keys
(that is what discharges the guard at each pair's `:`), while the saved-key
producer needed the plain scans of its sub-values.  Two lemmas that feed each
other's hypotheses on sub-derivations are ONE induction split cosmetically;
the fix is the merge (`emit_scans_in_flow_both`), and projections keep every
caller unchanged.

**The limit that splits pipelines.**  A twin pipeline is only as strictenable
as its weakest EXPOSURE.  The indexed tower carries floors and no-overwrite
machinery but ZERO reservation-layout exposures — the discharge cannot even be
STATED there — so the same one-line scanner change the legacy tower absorbed
is deliberately reverted on the indexed side, the divergence pinned by guards
(`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ScannerFlowPropsColon.lean` §4), and the missing
substrate is now a measured budget instead of a surprise.

Self-contained: models the shipped instance's counts (L4YAML item 9r,
2026-08-09) and pins that the hypothesis ripple, not the guard's own site
count, is where the landing went.
