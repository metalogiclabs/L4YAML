# Reflection 638 — sweep the divergence before porting the check; fix the resting state, not the verdict

**The rule.**  A recorded twin-pipeline divergence names a SHAPE and a
PRESCRIPTION ("`x⏎: v` diverges; the lenient side must adopt the strict
side's check").  Before executing the prescription, SWEEP the shape's
neighborhood differentially: the recorded shape is one point of the
divergence's true extent, and the prescription inferred from one point can
name the wrong side.  Then port the STATE where the two walks first part —
here, the cursor's resting position after a failed continuation probe — not
the downstream check that happens to make the recorded shape's verdicts
agree.  A check-port freezes the symptom; a state-port closes the family.

The shipped instance (L4YAML item 14): item 13's artifact recorded that the
indexed scanner rejects `x⏎: v` at scan (`invalidImplicitKey`) where legacy
accepts and rejects at parse, and prescribed "legacy must adopt the check".
A 5,460-input sweep over the 4-character alphabet `{x, :, ⏎, ␠}` found the
recorded shape was one of **580** divergent inputs in TWO families with ONE
root: the indexed plain-scalar walk had dropped legacy's **no-gain rewind**
at the cursor cutover — its own docstring still promised "the loop
terminates at the pre-fold cursor", but no code implemented it.  Family A
(354): verdict-equal error-STAGE differences, matrix-invisible.  Family B
(**226**): content differences on ACCEPTED inputs — `x⏎⏎` kept the fold's
`\n` in the indexed scalar — invisible to the matrix AND the suites because
no corpus case puts a bare top-level plain scalar before a trailing blank
line.  The prescription was BACKWARDS: porting the check into legacy would
have preserved family B and entrenched the defective walk.  Restoring the
rewind (`backtrackIfNoGain`, one `@[inline]` helper wrapping both fold
arms) closed all 580 at once.

**Why the wrong prescription got recorded.**  The divergence surfaced
mid-pass, as a side observation of item 13's probing, and was written down
as symptom + guess.  Symptom-notes age into wrong prescriptions; re-derive
the mechanism before executing one (R622's stale-pin lesson, one level up:
here the stale artifact was a PLAN entry, not a test assertion).

Self-contained: a two-policy miniature of the walk (rewind vs rest-past-
the-break) whose END-TO-END verdicts agree everywhere while the collected
content differs — the shape of a divergence that verdict-level comparison
cannot see — plus the shipped instance's counts (item 14, 2026-08-11).
