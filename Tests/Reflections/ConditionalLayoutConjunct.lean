# Reflection 635 — a conditional conjunct replaces a parallel tower

**The rule.**  When a strictened guard needs a LAYOUT fact threaded through a
predicate tower, there are two architectures.  The legacy landing (item 9r)
grew a SECOND tower — `EmitScansInFlowSavedKey`, carrying the reservation
index alongside the plain scans — and then had to MERGE the two
(`emit_scans_in_flow_both`) when the producers turned out to feed each other's
hypotheses.  The indexed landing (item 11) carried the same fact as **one
conditional conjunct on the existing predicate**:

    simpleKeyAllowed = true → LastRawNotValueIx s → SavedKeyAtEntryBoundaryIx s'

Three lessons made the single-tower form work:

1. **The antecedents are state bits the machine itself flips, and they
   SELF-SELECT the positions that owe the layout.**  After `{`, `[` or `,`
   both antecedents hold — the conjunct is LOADED exactly at key positions,
   where the following `:` will read the boundary.  After `: ` the raw array
   ends in the just-emitted `.value`, so `LastRawNotValueIx` FAILS — the
   conjunct is VACUOUS exactly at value positions, where a saved key would sit
   directly above a `.value` and no boundary could be proven.  No second
   predicate, no merge lemma: the state bits do the case split that the
   parallel tower encoded structurally.

2. **Walking the induction discovers the antecedent set — and what it is
   missing becomes a HYPOTHESIS, not a conjunct.**  The scalar case needs
   only the antecedents (save-then-push).  The collection-as-key case — the
   reservation crossing a whole `[`…`]` body to be restored by the close —
   additionally consumed exact stack–flow-level sync for the raw-prefix chain
   (`SimpleKeyAboveFloorIx`'s stack half goes vacuous only under equality).
   Sync therefore joined the predicate's HYPOTHESES, where it self-propagates:
   the conclusions preserve both sides.

3. **Exposures come producer-shaped, the same triple at every boundary
   token.**  Opens expose (re-enable saves, cap the raw array, push the saved
   key); closes expose (restore the pushed key, `getElem?`-prefix); the comma
   exposes (re-enable, clear — item 9q — cap).  Stating the prefix legs on
   `getElem?` lets a scenario lemma expose them without naming the tokens it
   pushes.

**The measured budget held.**  Item 9r priced this landing — by building the
strictening and reverting — at five scenario-lemma exposures, one conditional
layout conjunct on `EmitScansInFlowIx`, and four assembler call sites.  That
is where the DESIGN went; everything else that surfaced at landing time
(comma/ws1/init-open exposures, the sync hypothesis threading) was transport.
With the guard strictened on both sides, the seven shapes of
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ScannerFlowPropsColon.lean` §4 — `[a: b: c]`, `[a: : b]`,
`[: :]`, `{a: : b}`, `[? : : a]`, `[a: &x : b]`, `[a: !t : b]` — reject at
BOTH scanners with the IDENTICAL `ScanError`, closing the last deliberate
legacy↔indexed divergence.
