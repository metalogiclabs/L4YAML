# Reflection 648 — a pinned existential does not only shrink the language; it propagates DOWNSTREAM as a side condition that reads like a fact about the domain

**The rule.**  [[AutoDetectedIsExistential]] says that inlining a production's
auto-detected parameter at its smallest legal value silently shrinks the
formalized language.  The second half of the damage is in the PROOFS.  Every
lemma about the wrapped construct now has to be stated where the pinned value
happens to be right, and that restriction gets recorded as a hypothesis —
`n = 0` — with a plausible-sounding justification attached.  The justification
is a numeric coincidence, not a fact about what the code does, and it survives
review precisely because it is TRUE at the value it names.

**The tell is the shape of the justification.**  If a side condition is
defended by arithmetic that happens to agree ("`n - 1` and `n` agree at
`n = 0`, so the two contexts coincide") rather than by the domain ("no producer
in this file opens a collection deeper than the document root"), it is an
artifact of a missing quantifier upstream.  Restore the quantifier and the
side condition evaporates — the widened lemma holds at every index, because
the existential is exactly the slack the disagreement needed.

**And the degenerate case was never an arm.**  The same pinning made four
dispatch lemmas split on whether a whitespace run was EMPTY, deferring the
non-empty half — eight escape-hatch call sites for what is one measurement:
the run's width IS the collection's indentation, and `nil` is width 0.  Reading
a run beats casing on its degenerate shape; the eight arms cost zero new arms.

Concretely (L4YAML): `seq-spaces(n,block-in) = n` and
`seq-spaces(n,block-out) = n-1`, so `SBlockNode_blockIn_to_blockOut` could only
be stated at `n = 0`, where truncating subtraction hides the gap — and its
comment said so, calling the context "inert at this indent".  With `[183]`'s
`m` bound on `SBlockNode.blockSeq`, `m+1` absorbs the step and the lemma holds
at every indent, which is what let `pendingMapValue` carry a nonzero one.

§1 is the model: two contexts one apart, pinned and widened.  §2 is the tell.
§3 is the run that was a measurement.  §4 sorts the consumers by whether they
READ the index.  §5 the shipped counts.

Self-contained: the two renderings, the failing and succeeding re-labellings,
the arm count, and the consumer split.

  A side condition defended by ARITHMETIC that happens to agree is an artifact;
  one defended by the DOMAIN is a fact.  The two are distinguishable without

/-! ## §3  The degenerate case was never an arm

  Pinning also forced the dispatch to CASE on whether the whitespace run before
  the indicator was empty, deferring the other half.  But the run is a
  measurement: its width is the collection's indentation, and the empty run is
  width 0.  Reading it collapses the split — the deferred half costs no new
  arm, because there was only ever one arm. -/

theorem cases_covers_only_the_degenerate (r : Run) (h : r ≠ 0) :

/-- …and the reading covers all of them, `nil` included, with ONE body. -/

/-! ## §4  Sort the consumers by whether they READ the index

  [[AwaitNotOpener]] measures a widening by its ELIMINATION sites.  A widening
  that re-indexes a carried closure needs a second measure: of the consumers
  that must now produce at the new index, how many actually mention it?  Those
  that do not transport verbatim; only the rest can block. -/

/-- A flow collection as the entry's value needs `SFlowContent n`. -/

    spendable in one item instead of waiting for the whole content layer. -/
