# Reflection 645 — an escape hatch's CALL-SITE count is not its coverage; report which inputs it still owns, and widen a gate rather than copy an arm

**The rule.**  Progress against a deferral, a `sorry`, or any other escape
hatch is a claim about its DOMAIN — which inputs still take it.  What is easy
to count is its SITES — how many times it is written in the source.  These move
together often enough to feel like the same number, and they are independent in
both directions: a copied arm composes strictly more input while the site count
rises, and an extracted helper drops the site count with nothing composed at
all.  Report the domain; use the site count only as a tripwire that asks *which
kind of edit did I just make?*

**And the answer to that tripwire is usually actionable.**  When a new case
wants an arm whose body it would share verbatim, widen that arm's GATE to a
disjunction instead of writing a second copy.  The same inputs leave, the body
stays single-sourced, and the two measures agree again.

Concretely (L4YAML): item 19 MERGED two producers of one package behind a
single gate, and `block_dispatch_deferred` fell from 22 call sites to 18 — the
number moved the way the progress did, which is exactly what makes it feel
trustworthy.  Item 20 then wanted the `?` indicator on an arm whose body the
`:` already had.  Copying that branch into all four block-dispatch lemmas
compiled first try and composed a whole new family of input — and pushed the
count back to **22**.  Widening the branch's condition from `c = ':'` to
`c = ':' ∨ c = '?'` instead (dispatching on the disjunct inside one join
lemma) composed the identical inputs at **18**.

§1 is the model and the two independence witnesses.  §2 is the honest measure.
§3 is the craft move — widen dominates copy, strictly.  §4 the shipped numbers,
including the one worth keeping: across items 19 and 20 the count went
22 → 18 → 18 while two whole input families left the deferral, so it moved once
in three edits.

Self-contained: the two measures, both independence witnesses, the dominance of
gate-widening over arm-copying, and the counts.
