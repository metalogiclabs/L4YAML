# Reflection 677 — a two-landing production rides the pending as a FACTORED closure

**The rule.**  A production whose halves land on different steps — a key
line and a value line — cannot be served by close-then-reopen: the second
half has no production of its own to reopen INTO, so the entry must stay
open across the break.  The closure the park already carries is a
composition, `close = route ∘ completion`; PRE-composing it at the park is
what forecloses the later half, because the composition, once taken, is one
stream, while the factors are every stream the production still admits.
Keep the factors as fields (the route on the opener's pending, the derived
pack on the content park), and the later landing re-enters the production
at the exact point the first landing left it.  The cost is one optional
field per park kind on the chain — `∨ True` everywhere else — and the
producers that pay it already built both factors inline.

**The instance** (item 51).  A standalone `: - w` line is not in the YAML
language (`[189]`'s empty-key value slot is `s-l+block-node`), so
`? a⏎: - w` composes only as ONE `[188]` explicit entry: `question_open_map`
factors its `explicitEmpty` closure into the entry route (`h_expl`), the
key-content park derives the value pack from it (`h_vpack` — the landing's
comments complete the KEY's `s-l+block-indented` half), the landed `:` at
the key's own column parks the value slot (`h_vslot`), and the same-line
`-`/`?`/`:` fills `[185]`'s compact alternatives.  The runtime's share is
the `[197]` column discrimination — the `:` is the value line only AT
`explicitKeyCol` — which both refused two over-acceptances and un-refused a
valid input (`? earth: blue⏎  : x⏎: - w`).

§1 the two park shapes; §2 the factored park serves the two-landing entry;
§3 the pre-composed park cannot — its one field is one stream, shown by
instantiating the acceptor. -/
