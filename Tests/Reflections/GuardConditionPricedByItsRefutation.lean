# Reflection 673 — a guard's condition is priced by its refutation

**The rule.**  A runtime guard added so that an invariant arm can REFUTE it —
"this input errors, so the arm's success hypothesis is absurd" — is priced by
that refutation, not by its runtime truth.  Every conjunct of the firing
condition must be (a) a fact the parked invariant CARRIES and (b) one a
preservation lemma TRANSPORTS to the state the guard actually reads.  A
conjunct that is true in every reachable state can still be unpayable (the
invariant never carried its provenance), and a conjunct that looks essential
can be replaced by a cheaper one the machine already records.

**The instance** (item 47).  `scanNextToken_checkAdjacentValue` refuses the
glued `:` after a completed node (`"a" :b`).  Its condition was cut three
times: keyed on the SAVED SIMPLE KEY it was true at every reachable park but
unpayable — flow closes restore the key from a stack no invariant couples to
the line; keyed on the token tail alone it over-fired — `:foo: v` is a legal
`:`-headed KEY at a line start (yaml-test-suite 2EBW); keyed on the token
tail plus the un-re-armed `simpleKeyAllowed` every park pays
(`StaleNodeTail`), the structural break re-arms the flag for the legal keys,
and each conjunct transports (`skipToContentLoop_simpleKeyAllowed_eq_of_needIndentCheck`,
the anyCol payload).

§1 the toy machine: a carried flag, a carried last-token, and a DERIVED cache
the invariant does not carry.  §2 the unpayable cut, measured: two parked
states agree on everything the invariant carries and disagree on the
derived-keyed guard — no arm built from the invariant can refute it.  §3 the
payable cut: decided by the carried fields alone, so the refutation is a
theorem of the invariant.
