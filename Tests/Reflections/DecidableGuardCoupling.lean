# Reflection 639 — guard the coupling with decidable state facts; the consumer case-splits, never derives

**The rule.**  A conditional constructor field that couples a parked
obligation to a machine check (R636's carrier) should be GUARDED by
decidable propositions of the type-parameter state — not by the check's
own success.  Then every consumer fires the field with `by_cases` alone:
guard true and pack present → compose; anything else → the standing
fallback.  The runtime check never enters the proof, at EITHER end — the
pack *is* the grammar evidence, and soundness never needed the validator's
semantics, only the state facts the validator also happens to read.

The shipped instance (L4YAML item 15): the implicit key `a: b`.
`scanValueValidate`'s §7.4 pass demands a possible saved key resting on
the current line; the coupling field on `pendingContent` is guarded by
exactly those two facts — `simpleKey.possible = true` and
`simpleKey.pos.line = line`, both decidable on the pending's scanner-state
parameter — and concludes pack-or-punt.  The park site derives the pack
from line arithmetic (`saveSimpleKey` stamps `pos := currentPos` at the
content START; the scan only advances the line, the folds strictly), and
the same-line-`:` consumer is three `by_cases` plus one field application.
Zero lemmas about `scanValueValidate` exist in the pass.

**The honesty pressure.**  A pack-or-punt field is logically vacuous — any
site can punt — so nothing OBSERVABLE detects a pack that never fires.
What forces the construction is the campaign's endpoint: deleting the
deferral (row 12's `scannerDrop` retirement) deletes the punt arm, and
only packed parks type-check.  Interim honesty is by construction, checked
by the elaborator at the pack-capable park sites.

**The secondary carrier rule.**  The pack's one-line witness needed "same
exit line ⇒ the next-line star collapsed" — a fact about positions bound
EXISTENTIALLY in `collectPlainScalarLoop_prod`'s conclusion.  No separate
lemma can name those witnesses; the fact must ride the SAME conclusion as
a conjunct, proven in the same induction (two fold arms refute it by
strict line growth; eleven arms pass it through).

Self-contained: the state/pack/field/consumer miniature, the strict twin
that models the deferral's deletion, the ∃-conjunct shape, and the shipped
instance's counts (item 15, 2026-08-11).
