# Reflection 637 — type the twin's closure as the original's; convert at its one producer

**The rule.**  A new parked obligation whose closure has the SAME SHAPE as an
existing constructor's should state it at the existing machinery's type — even
when its own grammar slot asks for a different index — and pay the conversion
ONCE, at the producer's capture site, where the grammar constructor is
actually applied.  Every consumer arm then becomes the existing constructor's
VERBATIM clone, because consumers never see the difference.

The shipped instance (L4YAML item 13): the first block-MAPPING pending.
`[189] c-l-block-map-implicit-value` wants its value node at `.blockOut`;
every consumer in the accumulation — content dispatch, flow open, block
scalar, SSL close — composes nodes at `.blockIn`.  Stating
`pendingMapValue.h_close` at `.blockOut` would have forked all four consumer
arms into context-converting variants.  Stating it at `.blockIn` and
converting at the ONE producer (`SBlockNode_blockIn_to_blockOut`, inert at
n = 0: `seq-spaces(0, BLOCK-OUT)` truncates to 0, separators and properties
re-label by definitional equality plus one constructor rebuild) made the
close/flow-open arms byte-for-byte clones and the content arm a near-clone.

**The fields you do NOT add.**  The sequence twin (`pendingBlock`) carries a
SECOND closure — the entries-level snoc — so sibling `- b` entries extend one
derivation.  The mapping twin omits it: sibling `: b` entries close the map
and re-open through `[211]`'s admitted bare-document continuation
(`implicitContinue`), so the entries-level fidelity is NOT load-bearing for
language membership — the op-tree-witness rule one level up.  One closure,
no new invariant conjuncts, and the structural/EOF/flow steps consumed the
new constructor through `close_with_ssl` without an edit.

Self-contained: a miniature two-context grammar with an inert conversion at
depth 0, plus the shipped instance's counts (item 13, 2026-08-10).

theorem consumerComposes (n : Nat) : MiniNode n .inCtx := .leaf n .inCtx

/-- The producer's capture: the grammar slot wants `.outCtx`, so the
    conversion happens HERE — the pending's closure still TAKES `.inCtx`,
    which is why the consumer above feeds it unchanged. -/
