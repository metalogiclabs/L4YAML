# Reflection 636 — the coupling rides the pending's type parameter

**The rule.**  When a PARKED obligation must fire a scanner guard one dispatch
later — a held `[96]` run refuting a repeated property — the coupling
("held ⇒ the guard's test is true") is a fact about the SCANNER STATE at the
moment of consumption.  Neither of the two obvious carriers can hold it:

* a **constructor field** cannot, because the pending's inductive has no
  scanner state in scope — its indices are surface positions; and
* a **parallel invariant conjunct** cannot, because nothing links its case
  analysis to the pending's constructor — a `white`-shaped companion next to a
  props-shaped pending is unprovable, not contradictory (Reflection 619's
  sibling-conjunct trap, one level up).

The dissolution: **parametrize the pending's TYPE by the scanner state it
accompanies** — the state at the end of the step that parked it, which is
byte-for-byte the state the consuming step receives.  One constructor reads
the parameter (its coupling fields quantify over `sc.tokens`/`sc.line`); the
other eight ignore it.  Because constructors never MENTION a parameter they
do not read, every existing construction term compiled unchanged — the whole
cost was type-level: 55 binder/conclusion sites gained `sc` (hypotheses) or
`s'` (conclusions), and 0 proof terms changed at non-props sites.

**The transport is the machine's own flag.**  The coupling is stated at step
start; the guard fires after preprocessing.  "No break was crossed in
between" is not a new hypothesis to thread — `needIndentCheck` is set by
`consumeNewline` and cleared only by the armed unwind branch (Reflection
624's field, read one level up): a pending parked at `flag = false` whose
next preprocessing kept `sp_mid = sp` still has the flag down, so the armed
branch REFUTES ITSELF and the line and both positioned token readings
survive to the dispatch.  One conjunct on one disjunction lemma carried all
of it.

**The consuming arm is a three-way split, and the guard's PASS does the case
analysis.**  On the run's line: `&`/`!` derive "my half is absent" by
CONTRAPOSITIVE (guard passed + coupling ⇒ index bit is false) and EXTEND the
run — the refutation and the construction are one arm; `*` is refuted
outright; every value-completing character becomes the run's `[161]` content
— or `[198] s-l+block-scalar`'s own props slot, which is why `&a |` needed
no new grammar: the slot was already in the rule.
