# Reflection 679 — the refused landings fund the reading

**The rule.**  A runtime floor check inside a scan loop is not only a
refutation device: once it covers EVERY landing of the loop, it is the
production's own justification at the checked index — the same induction
that builds the index-0 reading builds the reading at `n`, with the check's
negation as the only new fact per landing (the landing's run clears
`s-indent(n)` because the check would have refused it otherwise).  So before
generalizing a scan-loop induction, audit the loop's guards: a landing WITH
a floor check lifts for free, and a landing WITHOUT one is both a scanner
over-acceptance (spec-invalid inputs pass) and a hole in the reading (valid
inputs cannot lift) — one missing check, both halves, fixed by the same
edit.  Item 45 lifted derivations to AVOID the loop induction; this rule
says when the induction must after all be walked, the guards pay for it.

**The instance** (item 53).  The quoted collectors' FOLD landing has carried
the under-indent check since item 7 (and its tab gate in both contexts since
item 50), so `collectDoubleQuotedLoop_prod_at`/`collectSingleQuotedLoop_prod_at`
re-run the 0-inductions at any `n ≤ currentIndent + 1` and
`k:⏎  - "x⏎    y"` composes at the entry's own index.  The ESCAPED-break
landing (`"x\⏎y"`) had NO checks — `k:⏎  a: "x\⏎y"` was accepted end-to-end
though `[112] s-double-escaped(n)` ends in the same `s-flow-line-prefix(n)`
— and giving it the fold's three checks (on content landings; a blank
landing is `l-empty`, the fold's to check) both refused the invalid family
and made the escaped case of the induction provable.

§1 a loop over landings with a floor check; §2 the check's coverage IS the
reading at `n`; §3 an unchecked landing breaks both directions at once. -/
