# Reflection 658 — a runtime guard the proof cannot reach is usually a guard stated in the wrong coordinate

**The rule.**  When a branch is supposed to be refuted by a check the code
already performs, and the refutation will not go through, do not first conclude
that the coupling is expensive.  Ask which COORDINATE the check reads.  A guard
keyed on a value some derived state machine records — a saved position, a
cached index, a flag — is reachable from a proof only through an INVARIANT
about that value, and if no such invariant exists, building one is a separate
item.  A guard keyed on the coordinate the SPECIFICATION names is reachable
from what the proof already carries.  Restating the check in the
specification's coordinate is frequently verdict-preserving — the same accept
and the same reject on every input — and that is the cheap route.

This is [[PuntNamesACoordinate]] read in the other direction.  There the
PROOF was re-measured where the runtime writes; here the RUNTIME is re-stated
where the grammar measures.  The pair is the same observation twice: a
mismatch between two sides is a mismatch of coordinates far more often than it
is a mismatch of strength.

**And the restatement is a claim you can test.**  "Verdict-preserving" is a
statement about the program, so [[VacuityIsAClaimAboutTheRuntime]]'s rule
applies to your OWN edit: build the corpus and run both readings.  If they
agree everywhere, the edit costs no behaviour and buys reachability; if they
disagree, you have learned that the old guard was not the check you thought it
was, which is worth more.

**The bridge needs BOTH endpoints.**  Between a symbolic run — a chain of
grammar steps — and a concrete buffer the runtime walks, "the same characters"
is not "the same place".  Two facts are owed, and both were missing here: that
the buffer is still the SAME buffer after the intervening step, and that the
run occupies a SEGMENT of it.  Neither is interesting; both are load-bearing,
and a bridge that proves only one of them proves nothing
(`same_content_is_not_same_place`, `suffix_pins_the_place`).

**Check upstairs before pricing a missing premise.**  The refutation here is
sound only in one context (block, not flow), so it needs that context as a
premise — and the premise turned out to be already decided one level up, in
the caller's own case split, and simply never passed down.  A hypothesis that
looks like new work is often an argument that is not being threaded
(`premise_decided_upstairs`).

Concretely (L4YAML): item 31 gave `scanValue` a §6.1 check anchored at the
ENTRY's first character — the KEY when the simple-key machine has recorded
one, the `:` otherwise.  That is the right verdict, and the accumulator could
not use it: `simpleKey.pos` is a coordinate the grammar accumulation has no
coupling for, so "there is no key on this line" was unprovable even though the
line in front of the `:` was known to be whitespace.  Item 32 added
`tabInLineIndent`, the same verdict computed from `s.col` — walk back exactly
the line's own characters, refuse if they are all `s-white` and one is a tab —
which is the coordinate `[187] l+block-mapping`'s `s-indent(n)` names.  Both
readings agree on the whole `yaml-test-suite` (per-test details byte-identical)
and on a 3,267-case tab-shape differential in both pipelines; the branch became
refutable and the four escape sites closed.

§1 the coordinate.  §2 verdict-preserving is testable.  §3 both endpoints.
§4 the premise upstairs.  §5 the shipped counts.

/-! ## §1  Two guards, one verdict, one reachability

A line, modelled as the characters in front of the token plus whatever the
state machine recorded about a key on it. -/

/-- The characters standing between the line start and the token. -/
abbrev Line := List Char

def isWhite (c : Char) : Bool := c == ' ' || c == '\t'

/-- The DERIVED coordinate: how far back a recorded key sits, or `none` when
    the machine recorded nothing.  Nothing constrains it by construction. -/
abbrev KeyMark := Option Nat

/-- The guard as item 31 wrote it: walk back from the KEY when there is one,
    from the token itself otherwise, and report a tab in the whites walked. -/

  let run := match k with
    | none => l

/-- The guard as item 32 wrote it: walk back the WHOLE line, and report only
    when every character of it is a white — which is what makes the run
    `[63] s-indent(n)` rather than `[66] s-separate-in-line`. -/
def guardByLine (l : Line) : Bool :=
  l.all isWhite && l.contains '\t'

/-- The invariant the derived coordinate would need: a recorded key points at
    a character that is not a white — keys do not start inside indentation. -/
def keyMarkSound (l : Line) (k : KeyMark) : Prop :=
  ∀ d, k = some d → d ≤ l.length ∧ ∃ c, (l.drop (l.length - d)).head? = some c ∧ isWhite c = false

/-- Under the invariant, the two guards agree on an all-white line: a recorded
    key cannot sit inside one, so there is no key, so both read the same run. -/

/-- **Reachability is the difference.**  Drop the invariant and the two part
    company: a mark that points into the indentation makes the key guard miss
    a tab the line guard sees.  That gap is exactly what a proof with no
    coupling for the derived coordinate has to close, and why the check was
    unreachable rather than merely awkward. -/

/-- …and the key guard is not a function of the line at all: the SAME line
    gets two answers depending on what the state machine happened to record.
    The line guard takes no such argument, which is exactly why the proof can
    reach it — `[187]`'s `s-indent(n)` is measured on the line. -/

/-! ## §2  "Verdict-preserving" is a claim about the program

So it is tested, not asserted — and the test is the corpus, not the argument.
The composed check fires when EITHER reading does; on the reachable domain
that is the same set. -/

    the line reading only fires on an all-white line, where §1 has already
    shown the two agree. -/

A run of characters "in the input" and a run "before the offset" are the same
run only when two separate facts hold. -/

def placedAt (run : List Char) (tail : List Char) (b : Buffer) : Prop :=
  ∃ pre, b.chars = pre ++ run ++ tail

/-- **The trap.**  A run whose characters all occur in the buffer is not
    thereby a segment of it in the right place: content is not position. -/
theorem same_content_is_not_same_place :

    exactly `run` — which is the whole content of the bridge. -/
theorem suffix_pins_the_place (pre run tail : List Char) :
    placedAt run tail ⟨pre ++ run ++ tail⟩ := ⟨pre, rfl⟩

/-! ## §4  The premise that was already decided upstairs

The refutation holds only where the block grammar is the reading; in a flow
collection the same characters are legal separation. -/

  | block | flow
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Whether a tab in the run in front of the token is refusable. -/

    been given it.  A missing premise is worth looking for one frame up before
    it is priced as an invariant to build. -/
